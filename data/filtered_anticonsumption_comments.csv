Anticonsumption,"From the website:
Buy Nothing Day is just a few days away and world leaders are gathering for the climate summit in Copenhagen … now is the moment to communicate that our five-planet lifestyles are unsustainable, that we have to consume less. This year we’re calling for a Wildcat General Strike. Help spread the word by downloading this press release and distributing it as widely as you can. Then go to www.adbusters.org/BND and organize a Buy Nothing Day event or join one that’s already happening in your area.

BUY NOTHING DAY MORPHS INTO A WILDCAT GENERAL STRIKE ON THE EVE OF COPENHAGEN CLIMATE SUMMIT
Over the last few years – as people grow increasingly anxious about rising sea levels, melting glaciers and the possibility of a catastrophic tipping point on climate change – Buy Nothing Day has exploded into a global movement, inspiring the world’s citizens to live more simply and buy a whole lot less.
Designed to coincide with Black Friday in the United States (which falls on November 27 this year) and the unofficial start of the international holiday shopping season (Saturday, November 28), the festival takes many forms – from personal one-day fasts to relaxed family outings and from free, noncommercial street parties to politically charged public protests, credit card cut-ups, mall invasions and pranks and shenanigans of all kinds. Anyone can take part, provided they spend 24 hours without shopping.
“There’s only one way to avoid the collapse of this human experiment of ours on Planet Earth,” says Kalle Lasn, the co-founder of Adbusters Media Foundation, “we have to consume less … Our culture of excess and meaningless consumption – the glorified spending and borrowing of the past decade – is at the root of the ecological and economic crises we now find ourselves in.”
This year Buy Nothing Day organizers around the world are confronting the issue of meaningless consumption head on. In addition to the usual personal plunges and celebrations, we’re calling for a WILDCAT GENERAL STRIKE: a worldwide rejection of the value system that is killing our planet. As global leaders gear up for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen on December 7, we’re asking tens of millions of people around the world to bring the capitalist consumption machine to a grinding – if only momentary – halt.
“We hope to set off a chain reaction of refusal against consumer capitalism,"" says Lasn, “while sending a message to Barack Obama, Wen Jiabao and the other world leaders that failure in Copenhagen is not an option … We want legally binding limits on carbon emissions now!”

Anticonsumption,"Even ""Non-Profit"" groups use Junk Advertising to sway people to their way of thinking. Independent thought is discouraged by the Right and the Left equally.

Pick any hot-topic you see in the news and do your own research--rarely will the results be the same as the majority of advertising points that are currently circulating.

For example: ""We must stop Climate Change."" is a loud popular subject. A little research shows a different story, though. There is no amount of money that can stop Climate Change. It is happening and the amount of contribution added by the average person is negligible compared to the contributions added by Corporations and Industry. Yet, advertising and climate change groups would have us switch out our light bulbs to fix the problem. The reality: 1 brand new CFL bulb has already used more energy being manufactured than it will ever save in its full lifetime. The only benefits of switching out light-bulbs is that it will cost less money to operate in the short term and the mess from making it is far away from the user. The overall pollution and energy cost of mining the materials, manufacturing the bulbs, shipping them to market and then collecting them for recycling is far more than the overall pollution of operating simple incandescent bulbs. *If you think CFL bulbs are a good deal, you should read up on the [communities of people who are enduring mercury poisoning](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6211261.ece) in order to provide the bulbs for the Western markets.*

Anticonsumption,"Well it's a nice fantasy that we'll switch quickly to public transit, but I think it's gonna actually take a long time. That kind of infrastructure takes decades to build. In terms of environmental impact the benefits are very dependent on what type of transit it is. For example commuter light rail projects tend to be very well used and have a relatively low impact, in part because the trains are small and light, and therefore efficient. Buses can be better than cars, but you have to have the right sizes for the lines you're running. Running nearly empty buses is very inefficient. Intercity rail is perhaps better than freeways, but it's a toss up. Anything is better than flying. 

In any event you need a lot of transit options before people are willing to give up their cars. You can't channel the money away from cars until people start to see the benefits of the public systems. They're expensive to build, and have a hard time covering running costs with rider fares. The easiest approach is to start with the urban centers and work outwards. You have to use public money, so you have to start showing benefits early on. Building public transit is one of the best investments in the future a country can make, but in order to invest you need to have money! In N. America, people will continue to use cars for long distances for the foreseeable future.

Clearly fuel prices are going to go up, and eventually we'll have to phase out fossil fuels entirely. What's not so obvious is what's going to be the sequence of changes. I think it's pretty likely that we'll be stuck in indecision about how to deal with global warming for at least the next decade, which means that serious eco-system collapse is pretty much locked in. It's not that we don't have the technologies to avoid that, it's just that no one is willing to give up their own conveniences, their own life choices, their own power. There will be a shift towards green technologies as the reality of anthropogenic global warming becomes obvious, but people will still be creatures of habit, short-sighted and self-interested, so our overall carbon emissions won't drop until the changes are forced on us by drought and famine.

Building out more public transit is a rational approach to minimizing carbon dependence for large cities, but to do it we need consensus, and that's hard to get when it won't be a win for everyone in the short run. I think the most positive direction is to start building enthusiasm for and knowledge of public transit, and sustainable dense urban growth in general. [James Howard Kunstler](http://www.kunstler.com/index.php) is an interesting author on sustainable city development. Personally I'm stoked to ride the first wide scale [PRT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit) as soon as some enterprising city builds one.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;What, in your opinion, is the exact problem with consumption?

It ruins people's lives. People spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, racking up enormous amounts of debt on credit cards to finance unsustainable lifestyles that still leave them feeling unsatisfied. They work their asses off to get enough money to buy crap they don't need, then they buy it, and they have no time to enjoy it or to relax, and they wonder why they're unhappy.

It squanders finite resources. We're reached peak oil already. We'll reach peak coal is 30 years, and peak natural gas in 25 years. We're going to reach peak phosphorus in 20 years. What will be left for our children, and our grandchildren?

It destroys the environment. You've probably heard of the [Great Pacific Garbage patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Garbage_Patch), and of global climate change. You've probably heard that our water is contaminated with [mercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28element%29#Releases_in_the_environment) and [PCBs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl#Large-scale_environmental_contamination_events) from coal power plants. You've probably heard that [overfishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing#Consequences) is not only making fishing more expensive, but is also causing swarms of jellyfish to flourish in place of their natural predators. Name a fish you like and you'll find it's probably an endangered species. 

&gt;What does ""conspicuous consumption"" mean to you?

Conspicuous consumption is when you buy things in order to compete with or impress your friends and neighbors. You buy a nice car, or a nice home not so much for yourself but for the social status you imagine it would bring you.

&gt;How would you go about remedying it?

For me? Stop buying things I don't need. As a national policy? Ban mass-media advertisements, except in exclusively advertisement-only media sources. Advertisement harms the market in two ways. It biases consumers to prefer purchasing from big companies, even when small companies offer an equivalent product at a lower price (e.g. generic medicine). It entices people to spend money that they otherwise would save, and use for more important purchases like emergency funding, investment, or savings for education and retirement. The entire mass-media advertisement industry needs to go, along with spam and telemarketing.

It harms the economy in a third way, by making companies spend enormous amounts of money to manipulate consumers, rather than spending that money on making better products or offering lower prices or higher wages. In the pharmaceutical industry, advertisement accounts for 2/3rds of expenses.

If one drug company were to start spending less on advertisements, it would be overtaken by other drug companies. If you ban advertisements for all companies, then they will be on an equal playing field, and they will have to compete by offering better products, better after-sales service, and lower prices, and, moreover, they'll have the spare money to be able to compete.

&gt;Do you think people can figure this out for themselves or do you think some ""intervention"" is needed?

I don't think intervention is necessary. I don't think you can stop it, ultimately.

The phrase ""save the planet"" is a convenient short hand for a set of necessary values and changes that are otherwise difficult to quickly summarize.

What it refers to is the fact that current human industrialized consumer society is unsustainable. We have a choice to face. We can continue ""business as usual"", in which case rapid, practically irreversible and catastrophic climate change is assured and we face a massive and rapid population collapse (not only of human population, but also a bio-diversity collapse). Or we can quickly reorient our society towards sustainable practices in order to avert or reduce the human suffering associated with an otherwise inevitable societal collapse and in the process, hopefully maintain more of the current diversity of living species.

Anticonsumption,"I might come back and support these claims with more sources, but for now I'll just state that you are wrong on several accounts. First of all, he is describing our modern world, probably with the intent of making us learn more from the past as we create the future. This document could help people break from the normal socialization and question whether their current conditions are really so good. So it's not just whining.

* 2) Any anthropologist will tell you that many peoples have had, and have more leisure time than we do in our political economy.

* 5) The ongoing ecocide, massive soil erosion, global climate change and an enormous population depending on finite fossil fuels for food production are some examples of enormous problems that we have created recently.

* 6) It seems you have a very simplistic view of The Past vs. The Present. Again, ask an anthropologist. There have existed, and still exist many peoples who are not modern, but who are much more healthy than we are. 

* 7-9) You might not value local community, but practically everyone else does

* 10-12) For gods sake, are you suddenly a logical positivist nihilist or something? It is ok to value something over something else.

* 13-14) Again with the Past vs. Present. There is and has been more abundance to cover the needs and wants of people in many places at many times than what we have now.

I seriously cannot grasp how you can be so morally relativistic in one sentence, and then uncritically use nostalgia as an insult throughout your post. Don't you know that valuing newness is a defining characteristic of the modernistic world-view? So calling a critic of the modern world ""nostalgic"" is just another way of saying that you have different values than he does. Yet you seem to think you are somehow refuting him by doing so.

“Although recycling is important, it should be but one activity in a series of behavior changes aimed at reducing climate change. Switching to wind or other renewable energies, consuming less meat, conserving daily energy use and eating locally grown food are other effective ways to mitigate climate change, to name but a few. However, if individuals and institutions participate in recycling programs, they may be prone to the single-action bias and feel like they are already doing enough to protect the environment.” 

Basically, recycling is good, but if you're just recycling to justify your consumerism, you're not really doing anything beneficial. It's like a person who drives more because they bought a hybrid. It's just cancelling out the good behavior with more bad behavior.

Note that of the three words on the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle slogan, recycling was last. It's also the easiest, which is why most people religiously cling to it while ignoring the other two, even though Reducing consumption and reusing things are much better than recycling.

slaves, more or less. What happens is that the ants climb to the underside of leaves near the forest floor, secure themselves to the leaves and then die, becoming a food source for the fungus.""

&gt; ""Eventually the positioning of the ant corpse serves to allow the spores to burst out of the ant’s head and rain down on other ants. This is true. And it’s very successful. There is fossil record of this occurring up to 48 million years ago. The thing that’s fascinating about this to me is that the ant is acting mindlessly against its own interests and the interests of its fellow ants by becoming a tool of the fungus. I think a similar system has evolved in our culture.""

&gt; ""It’s also equally ludicrous to believe that – at the very least – this mass distraction and manipulation is not convenient for the people who are in charge.  People are starving. They may not know it because they’re being fed mass produced garbage. The packaging is colourful and loud, but it’s produced in the same factories that make Pop Tarts and iPads, by people sitting around thinking, ‘What can we do to get people to buy more of these?""

&gt; ""And they’re very good at their jobs. But that’s what it is you’re getting, because that’s what they’re making. They’re selling you something. And the world is built on this now. Politics and government are built on this, corporations are built on this.""

&gt; ""Interpersonal relationships are built on this. And we’re starving, all of us, and we’re killing each other, and we’re hating each other, and we’re calling each other liars and evil because it’s all become marketing and we want to win because we’re lonely and empty and scared and we’re led to 
believe winning will change all that. But there is no winning""

&gt; ""What can be done? Say who you are, really say it in your life and in our work. Tell someone out there who is lost, someone not yet born, someone who won’t be born for 500 years. Your writing will be a record of your time. It can’t help but be that. But more importantly, if you’re honest about who you are, you’ll help that person be less lonely in their world because that person will recognise him or herself in you and that will give them hope. It’s done so for me and I have to keep rediscovering it. It has 
profound importance in my life. Give that to the world, rather than selling something to the world.  Don’t allow yourself to be tricked into thinking that the way things are is the way the world must work and that in the end selling is what everyone must do. Try not to. ""

-Charlie Kaufman

-----------------------

This is the central problem with consumerism.  It's an ongoing manipulation and propaganda program, drilled into every one of our sensory inputs day in and day out, non stop for the entirety of our lives.  The agencies doing this are large and powerful and know exactly what they are doing.  In other societies, we referred to these agencies as *Ministries of Propaganda.*  In our society, we refer to them as *marketing departments* and *public relations.*  

Their goal is to keep people spending - spending on things that they don't need to buy, and didn't even have the desire to buy until they were told that they did.  And it becomes our identity.  ""Shopping"" is now a past-time; we start to think that what we own defines who we are and what we think.  ""What does this car / coffee table / bedframe say about me?""

And the goal of our system is to keep everyone working as much as possible, as hard as possible (and paid as little as possible), to produce more, to sell more.  And the net effect on the planet is that it is turning every country - every economy into a hole in the ground.  Extract the resources and move on to the next - with little or no thought to sustainability or self-sufficiency, just more holes in the ground until there's nothing left to plunder for a profit.  

We're wasting our planets limited and depleting resources on trivial products - the vast majority of which we discard every year, or two or five years for newer, shinier products.  And we have so much stuff now, stuff that sits in storage garages, never to be used, and stuff that sits in empty rooms of our homes, never touched.

Consumerism is a terrible evil in our existence on this planet, and is threatening larger environmental catastrophe - through both global climate change and resource depletion.

CHAPTER XIII.
HOPE AND FEAR ARE THE BANE OF HUMAN LIFE.
No man can be said to be perfectly happy that runs the risk of disappointment: which is the case of every man that fears or hopes for anything. For hope and fear, how distant soever they may seem to be the one from the other, they are both of them yet coupled in the same chain, as the guard and the prisoner; and the one treads upon the heels of the other. The reason of this is obvious, for they are passions that look forward, and are ever solicitous for the future; only hope is the more plausible weakness of the two, which in truth, upon the main, are inseparable; for the one cannot be without the other: but where the hope is stronger than the fear, or the fear than the hope, we call it the one or the other; for without fear it were no longer hope, but certainty; as without hope it were no longer fear but despair.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Let's take buying a Christmas toy from China from Walmart. In your thoughts, how does that burden someone?

Lots of contingencies determine how that burdens others, and whether it is unsustainable. What resources were required to make that toy? How was it shipped? How will it be disposed of? I believe that these are the relevant factors involved in determining how acceptable one's consumption is. In the case of buying a toy from wal-mart, it is most likely, but not necessarily, that the toy was made by unacceptable means. However, even then the durability and satisfaction one has with the object can still be the determining factor. If a child is satisfied with the toy, and that toy does not need to be replaced with another toy for many years, then it is more likely that the buying of that toy was in some way sustainable. 

The problem is that planned obsolescence and consumer culture leads to people, primarily in wealthy countries, buying huge amounts of things, and then replacing those things with newer things within a ridiculously short amount of time. Consumption like this, at least at our current level of technology, is not sustainable: we as a species cannot go on consuming at our current rate. It our mentality of 'buy now, worry later' that has led us to our current environmental problems with acid rain, global warming, emptying water aquifers, pilfered land and ocean ecosystems, razed rainforests, and a near endless list of other environmental concerns.

To deny that excessive consumption exists, one must believe either two things: that we are not existing in an age of unsustainable conumption, and that an environmental crisis is not imminent, or that a we are living unsustainably as a human race, and it is only a natural course that these issues must come about. I deny both of these premises, and instead vie that humanity must change its consumption habits in order to save ourselves from self destruction.",1387308431,gt let take buying christmas toy china walmart thoughts burden someone lots contingencies determine burdens others whether unsustainable resources required make toy shipped disposed believe relevant factors involved determining acceptable one consumption case buying toy likely necessarily toy made unacceptable means however even durability satisfaction one object still determining factor child satisfied toy need replaced another toy many years likely buying toy way sustainable problem planned obsolescence consumer culture leads people primarily wealthy countries buying huge amounts things replacing things newer things within ridiculously short amount time consumption least current level technology sustainable species consuming current rate mentality worry later led us current environmental problems acid rain emptying water aquifers pilfered land ocean ecosystems razed rainforests near endless list environmental concerns deny excessive consumption exists one must believe either two things existing age unsustainable conumption environmental crisis imminent living unsustainably human race natural course issues must come deny premises instead vie humanity must consumption habits order save self destruction

It found that typical plastic bags have the least impact on global warming. Now my understanding for the plastic bag bans is to keep plastic out of the oceans so maybe global warming isn't really considered. 

The study found that the biggest environmental impact a bag has is in its resource use and production stages. Bag to bag a plastic bag has lower resource use and environmental production cost than a cotton bag or paper bag, for example.

We should be mindful that you have to re-use a cotton tote 131 times (without washing it) before the global warming/environmental impact falls below a single use plastic bag. Paper bags have to be re-used 3 times, etc. If you are a person who re-uses your plastic bags (e.g. as garbage bags) then the re-use numbers for other forms of bags climb even higher.

&gt;This film asks the most critical question of our time: How do we become a sustainable civilization? It takes a unique approach among modern environmental documentaries: Rather than dispensing facts about climate change; peak energy, food and water; and biodiversity loss, it examines the cultural barriers that prevent us from acting rationally.

&gt;It asks why population conversations are so difficult to have, and why a roaring economy is more important to us than a survivable planet. It looks into the psychology of denial and crowd behavior. It explores our obsession with community growth and economic growth.

&gt;Hooked on Growth holds up a mirror, encouraging us to examine the beliefs and behaviors we must leave behind, and the values we need to embrace, in order that our children can survive and thrive.

Anticonsumption,"You're correct that industrial society functions on scalability and it leads to positive feedback loops.  Therefore, through industrialization, billions of people are able to afford better lifestyles.  For some markets, this can lead to a winner-take-all type system especially when the marginal cost of production is low (such as for digital goods).  You can see this sort of action occuring right now with regard to the kindle book format.

However, as business or government expands, costs can also rise and lead to a negative feedback loop.  There are many opinions on the collapse of the Roman Empire.  One of the theories is related to taxation.  Once the empire become large and complex it became increasingly costly for the empire to maintain possessions far away from the center of the empire.  The costs associated with collecting taxes and maintain the empire became too large and the empire as a result had to contract.

I highly recommend Joseph Tainter's fascinating book ""The Collapse of Complex Societies"" (1990).  He provides examples of several complex societies that have collapsed throughout history.  Several theories are presented such as resource exhaustion, famine, war, etc.  His overall point is that complex societies inevitably collapse (or become less complex) once the marginal cost of maintaining the society produces dimishing/negative returns.  At that point the society will scale back into more efficient small scale units.

The scenario you paint is quite possible.  If people stopped caring because the costs of those items were no longer important or had negative returns, the society could shift into a more efficient system in which people consumed less.  Yes, it would destroy the economy, but we would form a new economy where people rent houses, buy less clothes, download music, etc. as you suggest.  This would be a shift from a complex industrial society to a less complex pre-industrial society.  As I said above, there are many examples throughout history of civilizatons reverting to a less complex state.  There is nothing preventing this from happening, but something would need to provoke the change.  This could be something such as global warming, famine, depletion of oil reserves, and similar global threats to current industrial system.  

Edit: I should also say that just because an industrial society could revert to a less complex state, that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Anticonsumption,"Very interesting. I am, for all intents and purposes, a thermal science grad student. We deal daily with efficiencies and global warming impacts. But over the past decade or so, people have started focussing on life cycle analysis. That is, say you replace a high global warming impact refrigerant in a system with a low GWP one. Then, even if the refrigerant itself doesn't damage the environment that much, the lost efficiency from the new one might overall cause more damage.

Of course, calculating the life cycle impact of something is more or less a fool's errand. The number depends on so many assumptions that you can basically get out whatever you want for your purposes. People are working to improve the methods, sure, but it is a) still primarily the reserve of academics and b) not related to consequences for manufacturers yet.

I've started realising that, soon, if humans want to keep expanding technologically in the face of finite resources, they will have to address the issue of life cycle impacts for everything. For instance, the small solar panels on your watch and calculators actually take more energy to make than they produce, which is a net loss. The same sort of thinking _should_ be applied to things like the Nest thermostat. Does the energy that went into manufacturing all of the offices, experimental units, workstations, the man-hours spent by engineers etc., does the Nest actually save _more_ energy than what went into just developing and releasing it? I'm not sure if the answer can be calculated, and even if it can, that the answer is favorable.

Therefore, as always, despite me loving engineering, from a sustainability point of view, common sense is king: Don't use, reduce, reuse, recycle. Quit the foolish dream of infinite progress.

3) Try to buy nothing new. This includes everything from clothes, to gifts, to houses.

Anticonsumption,"While despair is an understandable emotional response to displays of commercialistic depravity, I prefer my own to be one of gratitude.  I acknowledge that the logical basis for such a reaction is not obvious, so I will explain.

When such commercialistic activity becomes blatant and excessive to the point of exceeding any semblance of rationality or sanity, it becomes vastly easier for concerned individuals such as yourself, to become consciously aware of it, and to understand why such commercialism is destructive and undesirable.

The more awareness of it is generated, the less tolerance of it there will be, and the more people will begin to demand that it is no longer engaged in.

Although you have done so to an extent here, I would encourage you to catalogue all of the reasons why you believe advertising and marketing to be undesirable, and then once you have done so, make the resulting list or article available to the people closest to you.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Government initiates force with relative impunity. That is the difference.

The issue was accountability (not difference), and self-seeking being an obstacle to that.  Which can't be resolved by the market, because the market encourages such behavior/logic.  Which then leads to the same problem in the market as well as spill over into the state.  People in corporate america jsut don't even pretend to be accountable to the public and think differently than public service.

The EPA has proven itself to improve the lives of people.  Such things as removing lead from gasoline and the air, increasing fuel efficiency, controlling toxic substances, cleaner water, etc.  So it was a success in these areas without the interference of greed.  Where the market had every incentive to do the opposite.  Generally when people talk about greed in the government they mean where it is tied to industry -- such as the pentagon or energy subsidies -- but have no explanation for why social security and EPA and public education improve no politician or lobbyists' private fortunes; meaning they are not greed-based but democratic.  Except by redefining greed as simply wanting a thing at all and then claiming old people, environmental activists, and teachers are greedy in the same way that the owners of FIFA or Shell Oil are greedy.  Which is just sophism to justify the power of the wealthiest.

&gt;Always? What about reputation?

This has two problems.  One is that large corporations spend billions every year on marketing/PR, but also exercise considerable control over the news media.  Whether directly as owners of media outlets or indirectly as advertisers.  This means that they control their reputations much better than an average citizen as well as smear smaller organizations and individuals.  Also, as we see today, most people underestimate problems like pollution/global warming because the mass media just doesn't explain it thoroughly.  In fact, any negative problem of consumption is not going to be on tv if advertisers who rely on your consumption pay for it.  People then blame democracy not reacting quickly enough, without taking into consideration where the masses get their information and news.

Also, if we got rid of incorporation as we discussed earlier... corporations could just change their name if they got a bad reputation much easier.  They do this now in fact and no one is the wiser.  Corporations also own multiple 'brands' -- like countless [brands of sunglasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxottica#Brands) or [food/beverages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands).  One company might own like 75% of the brands at your grocery store and no one is the wiser.   So they can pretend that there is competition where there isn't.   If one brand of food poisoned you, they could pull it from the shelves without losing much.  Or just repackage it under a new name.

&gt;private property is human

On the one hand then humanity wouldn't be very old as most of human history people did not even have agriculture and civilization, much less private property or the specific types of property under modern capitalism.  Those had to be invented over time.  But ironically it is what holds back libertarianism for libertarians.  As long as you have capitalism, you are never going to get libertarianism.  It will only happen if there is a non-capitalist form of libertarianism.  Because the capitalist system -- and perhaps the whole technological system we can call it now -- requires heavily regulated states and subsidies.  The division of labor means people are more useless and non-self reliant.  So you have to have safety nets or more public sector jobs, because full employment is more and more impossible.  Syndicalism may not solve the issue because of the technology issue being so tied to capitalism and the state now.

When your mind is thinking/wandering it is constantly giving birth to thoughts, desire, despair and regret -- these end up being a part of you, without you realizing how these thoughts became yours. Meditating regularly helps you observe the process of development of these ideas and gets you closer to the source of your desires, dreams and disappointments, it is a really useful practice.

I was an environmental vegetarian, like yourself. I recently decided to also cut out eggs and dairy from my diet as well, because by supporting these industries, I felt like I was still supporting the environmental destruction caused by them.

When people ask me why I'm a vegetarian, (I don't tell people I'm vegan out of fear of confrontation,) I tell them that I do it for the environment. The responses I have gotten to this have been *astoundingly* ignorant.

Highlights from a 2014 [article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/04/climate-change-impact-vegetarian) fom *The Guardian*:

* In 2012, there were roughly 70bn animals raised as livestock for 7.1bn people. And a study published in July by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that livestock production is among the most destructive forces driving climate change: it degrades air quality, pollutes waterways, and is the single-largest use of land.
* Raising animals to eat produces more greenhouse gasses (via methane and nitrous oxide) than all of the carbon dioxide excreted by automobiles, boats, planes and trains in the world combined.

And a study published in July by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that livestock production is among the most destructive forces driving climate change: it degrades air quality, pollutes waterways, and is the single-largest use of land.

* Raising animals to eat produces more greenhouse gasses (via methane and nitrous oxide) than all of the carbon dioxide excreted by automobiles, boats, planes and trains in the world combined.
* Besides the methane and nitrous oxide released during livestock production, industrialized livestock contributes to roughly 75% of deforestation (to give animals grazing grounds and grow soybeans used in feedstock).

And it accounts for respectively 37 per cent of all human-induced methane (23 times as warming as CO2), which is largely produced by the digestive system of ruminants, and 64 per cent of ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain.""](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsID=20772)

However, once you slit its throat, put a bullet or steel bar through its head, drown or suffocate it, or any other way to kill an animal... it's violence!

However, humans have evolved and figured out ways to get sufficient nutrition in ways that don't intentionally bring harm to animals.

First, if we go with the IPCC numbers the animal agriculture industry is still one of the primary drivers of climate change. Yet ""enviromental groups"" have for a really long time ignored the issue in their campaigns. The ""cowspiracy"" argument with regard to climate change stands even if we drop the 51% number. 

Second, while the Goodland/Anhang report's prognosis is an outlier and the movie would have been more accurate if they had portrayed it as such the arguments for/against the report are not as clear cut as you say. See the co-director's reply to critics at http://www.cowspiracy.com/blog/2015/11/23/response-to-criticism-of-cowspiracy-facts which I'll now quote from.


&gt; The Goodland/Anhang analysis was peer-reviewed. In order for employees of the World Bank to do any press or have articles published they must have it cleared by the World Bank first. Goodland and Anhang used the global standard for measuring GHGs http://www.ghgprotocol.org/city-accounting, something that the FAO report did not even do.

Goodland/Anhang responded to criticism of their analysis here: http://www.animalfeedscience.com/article/S0377-8401(11)00517-7/abstract which explains their methodology.

Third, the content and goal of the film is much broader than what you here give it credit for. As the co-director writes (link above)

&gt; The purpose of the film was to raise awareness of the single most destructive industry facing the planet today: animal agriculture. Regardless of whether animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of GHGs or 51%, it is still a primary driver of climate change. But almost even more important, it is the leading cause of deforestation, desertification, ocean dead-zones, species extinction, habitat destruction, water use, water pollution, top soil erosion, etc. The fact that the entire environmental movement is focused on fossil fuels and not animal agriculture is to the detriment of true sustainability.

You write that

&gt; Even ten million more vegans will not have a meaningful impact

Anticonsumption,"Well, the first thing I'd suggest is getting some real sanity back. Go do something where you're actually *doing* something. Go ride a bike or take a hike or cook some real food. Don't think about how we're ruining everything and you're part of the problem - just chill out and do what you're doing.

The second thing I'd suggest is finding a community that is supportive of an anti-consumptive lifestyle. Probably the easiest ones to find are [people who like the outdoors](http://imgur.com/Z3Dh3Xe). Just search for things you might be interested in in your area.

The third thing is to come to terms with the fact that, as long as you look only at the little bubble that is your life, you cannot help but be responsible for the destruction of the planet. Even if you just kill yourself right now, they'll still need to build a casket and dig up some land to bury you. Whenever you buy an ear of corn, or a bus ticket, or a new pair of socks, you are contributing to the destruction - you'll never be able to get that down to zero. So the question is, how can you make up for the destruction that you, as an individual, will inevitably cause in your lifetime? The answer is to make human systems as a whole less destructive. And for this, especially in places like the US, we need political reform. We need to account for the environmental and societal negative externalities of capitalism, and we need to build physical and bureaucratic infrastructure that encourages conservation and production, rather than consumption. When you affect change in the world that will reduce the destruction of others living now and in the future, you make up for your own.

And so the question is How. And this is where it gets interesting - you have to figure it out. Probably the most straightforward is to find reputable political groups and donate money to them. Fact is, political machines are what make the changes in our society, and political machines run on money. In addition to donating, you can volunteer and stay up to date on current issues. Not just the big issues that make national headlines like climate change summits and the acidification of the oceans - but issues relevant to where you live, like the construction of new highways and the levying of new gas taxes.

Anticonsumption,"I'm wondering where you're getting that figure. If you are getting it from Cowspiracy, or whatever sources it cites, you should read [this](http://newint.org/blog/2016/02/10/cowspiracy-stampeding-in-the-wrong-direction/):

&gt;Emissions from livestock agriculture – including the methane from animals’ digestive systems, deforestation, land use change and energy use – make up around 15 per cent of global emissions, not 51 per cent.

The [EPA](https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/industry.html) notes that there are 5 major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions: Electricity at 30%; Transportation at 26%; Industry at 21%; Commercial and Residential at 12%; and Agriculture at 9%. 

Of course, a major flaw in these numbers is that they account for emissions *produced* rather than *consumed*. This sort of statistical slight of hand allows rich countries to blame large amounts of emissions on developing nations who are producing the goods they are consuming. So let's account for this - ballparking, of course.

The [USDA](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-meat-international-trade-data.aspx) finds that the US imports a net of 136,209,000 lbs of beef. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/) states that a good estimate of CO2eq (US standard industrial agricultural practices) is 22.3kgCO2eq/kgBeef. Using the power of mathemagics, we can say

13209000 * 22.3 = 294,560,700 lbs CO2eq

(we don't need to convert kg to lbs, since the 22.3 is given as a ratio of kg/kg).

Meanwhile, the same EPA page from above states the US produces (domestically) a total of 6,870,000,000 Metric Tons CO2eq. So the total amount of emissions due to agriculture is

6870000000 * .09 * 2205(lbs/MTon) = 1,363,351,500,000 lbs CO2eq

Then, let's multiply the emissions due to foreign beef by 100 to account for all the other meats, unnoticed externalities, and evil corporations lying to us. The total emissions due to agriculture would then be

294,560,700 + 1,363,351,500,000 = 1363646100000 lbs CO2eq

The percentage increase being

1363646100000/1,363,351,500,000*100 - 100 = 0.021%

Of course, this is all very back-of-the-envelope. If you want to submit some of your own sources or calculations, or reasonably criticize some aspect of mine, I would be interested in reading. But according to what I've calculated, and the first article I linked, while meat production is a substantial and important contributor to greenhouse gas production, it does not dominate the field. 

So, why does this myth - that meat production is such a huge contributor to global warming - keep getting passed around? Really, it comes down the the vegan agenda. Not that all vegans are secretly in on some conspiracy or something - though some of the more vocal ones are certainly not being entirely honest - but more of an implicit agenda. Veganism, at least hard core (that is, the base of the group/movement/lifestyle), is something like a religion. It has a rule, which is to be followed without question - the rule being ""don't consume animal products"". If such a rule were not the foundation of veganism, and the movement was instead actually based around the welfare of humans and animals, then vegans would have no problem eating meat that would not contribute to the harm of animals. For example, if a non-rule-following vegan lived in near a National Forest where the deer population was getting out of control and the forest service was asking for hunters to cull the population, a vegan would have no problem shooting deer until the forest service said the herd had been sufficiently culled, and then would likely eat the meat since it would otherwise go to waste (though they should also be spending their time publicly advocating for the reintroduction of apex predators into the forest ecosystem).

Meanwhile, vegans and animal rights supporters in general tend to have a strong overlap with environmentalists, and tend to have overlapping goals. For example, meat production *does* contribute to global warming (as well as the more general pollution of ecosystems) significantly more than a plant-based alternative. So, when someone says that beef production is responsible for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions, this is *very* appealing. While the basis of veganism (western veganism, anyway) is always some sort of animal welfare or animal autonomy, the movement as a whole has realized that a great many people just don't care about this - so they have a tendency to point out other benefits, such as better health or environmental conservation. And since they are dedicated to the complete elimination of animal exploitation, they tend to overhype the benefits of veganism for non-animal-welfare ends. So when a vegan hears that beef is a huge contributor to greenhouse gasses, they will immediately recognize that this idea supports their primary agenda, while also supporting overlapping agendas that will push non-vegans to become vegan (or closer to vegan) and call for pro-vegan action. This ""fact"" is especially appealing because it significantly reduces the need for people to make other sacrifices in their lives in order to be on the right side of carbon production, if only they'll stop eating beef.

But the fact is, this just isn't true. This argument relies heavily on the same distrust of the broad scientific community that global warming denialists use. If beef was actually such a large contributor to global warming, the scientific community would have recognized it long ago and would be in strong agreement over the fact. Instead, we must recognize that global warming is *hard*. There are no silver bullets. If we truly desired justice in emission distribution, Americans will have to largely give up meat - as well as excessive driving, large houses, air conditioning, and mindless material consumption. It is largely agreed that the most effective way of reigning in greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining reasonable standards of living is to place a steadily increasing tax on CO2, both domestically and via import, combined with government support for people who will be negatively impacted by such a tax. And there will be *a lot* of people who are negatively impacted, since increases in energy costs have a multiplication effect down the supply chain, substantially increasing the price of just about all consumer goods.

And this is why I'm so much more interested in revitalizing American cities, rather than ending beef production. When people are closer together, they have more access to more things for less resource use. No matter what means a person uses to transport themselves, it will almost always take less energy to commute half a mile to work from an urban apartment, rather than 15 miles from a suburban house. If there is left over food in a city, it can be distributed to the poor easily, rather than thrown away or turned into compost. If someone no longer uses a tool, it is much more likely they will sell it to a neighbor than leave it rusting in their yard. More compact, efficient, and livable cities, if designed properly, will allow us to maintain a much higher standard of living while applying climate change austerity measures.

And the *most* important part of creating better cities is that *living in cities makes people more liberal*. There is a *strong* correlation between city living and political leftism. And liberals are more likely to both care about global warming *and* animal welfare - so even if animal welfare is your top priority, better cities *will help you, too*.",1462222037,wondering getting figure getting cowspiracy whatever sources cites read http gt emissions livestock agriculture including methane animals digestive systems deforestation land use energy use make around per cent emissions per cent epa https notes major contributors greenhouse gas emissions electricity transportation industry commercial residential agriculture course major flaw numbers account emissions produced rather consumed sort statistical slight hand allows rich countries blame large amounts emissions developing nations producing goods consuming let account ballparking course usda http finds us imports net lbs beef study http states estimate us standard industrial agricultural practices using power mathemagics say lbs need convert kg lbs since given ratio meanwhile epa page states us produces domestically total metric tons total amount emissions due agriculture lbs let multiply emissions due foreign beef account meats unnoticed externalities evil corporations lying us total emissions due agriculture would lbs percentage increase course want submit sources calculations reasonably criticize aspect mine would interested reading according calculated first article linked meat production substantial important contributor greenhouse gas production dominate field myth meat production huge contributor keep getting passed around really comes vegan agenda vegans secretly conspiracy something though vocal ones certainly entirely honest implicit agenda veganism least hard core base something religion rule without question rule consume animal products rule foundation veganism movement instead actually based around welfare humans animals vegans would problem eating meat would contribute harm animals example vegan lived near national forest deer population getting control forest service asking hunters cull population vegan would problem shooting deer forest service said herd sufficiently culled would likely eat meat since would otherwise waste though also spending time publicly advocating reintroduction apex predators forest ecosystem meanwhile vegans animal rights supporters general tend strong overlap environmentalists tend overlapping goals example meat production contribute well general pollution ecosystems significantly alternative someone says beef production responsible greenhouse gas emissions appealing basis veganism western veganism anyway always sort animal welfare animal autonomy movement whole realized many people care tendency point benefits better health environmental conservation since dedicated complete elimination animal exploitation tend overhype benefits veganism ends vegan hears beef huge contributor greenhouse gasses immediately recognize idea supports primary agenda also supporting overlapping agendas push become vegan closer vegan call action fact especially appealing significantly reduces need people make sacrifices lives order right side carbon production stop eating beef fact true argument relies heavily distrust broad scientific community denialists use beef actually large contributor scientific community would recognized long ago would strong agreement fact instead must recognize hard silver bullets truly desired justice emission distribution americans largely give meat well excessive driving large houses air conditioning mindless material consumption largely agreed effective way reigning greenhouse gas emissions maintaining reasonable standards living place steadily increasing tax domestically via import combined government support people negatively impacted tax lot people negatively impacted since increases energy costs multiplication effect supply chain substantially increasing price consumer goods much interested revitalizing american cities rather ending beef production people closer together access things less resource use matter means person uses transport almost always take less energy commute half mile work urban apartment rather miles suburban house left food city distributed poor easily rather thrown away turned compost someone longer uses tool much likely sell neighbor leave rusting yard compact efficient livable cities designed properly allow us maintain much higher standard living applying austerity measures important part creating better cities living cities makes people liberal strong correlation city living political leftism liberals likely care animal welfare even animal welfare top priority better cities help

But I don't believe that profit can be used as an excuse for creating a disaster.

Deflationary money which is not created as debt is the only way to really stop climate change. All this other crap like carbon taxes and changing light bulbs are fairly minute in their effectiveness.

Anticonsumption,"I will go against the grain and argue, that consumption is absolutely necessary in a modern society at this point.

This is because modern natural sciences require rapidly increasing amounts of computing power. Molecular biology, biochemistry, physics, climatology,… basically any field, that has advanced beyond the fundamentals: we need to analyze huge data sets, work with simulation models of increasing complexity, we're even *computing*, for example, structure of new chemical compounds for usage in medicine.

How do we get the computational power? Production of more and more computers (see microcomputers) and rapidly replacing them by new, much more efficient (see Moore's law) generations, while creating new markets, when the old ones are saturated (minicomputers, microcomputers, wearables). Consumption funds research and development in computing.

And we *need* that progress in natural sciences, because we rely on extremely efficient farming, power sources, medicine, materials… and we have to deal with ongoing issues, such as climate change.

However, there are plenty of areas, where such rapid progress doesn't happen, and we can and should be more efficient without hindering the progress, even if it's only to balance the consumption mentioned above.

There's also a social aspect, that isn't entirely related to consumption.

Plenty of companies don't make what people want in the first place, but they rather *make* people want something, and then satisfy that artificially created demand. The point is, the basic assumption, that parties operating in free markets are fully informed and equal in a way, is flawed, because companies have more resources and a much larger body of knowledge in psychology, that can be used to manipulate consumers.

Furthermore, consumers typically have to earn money first in order to consume, and in first-world societies, they often do so by working so-called [bullshit jobs](http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/), that don't actually produce anything valuable, but keep the system running, i.e., keep people busy and finance flowing.",1465423201,grain argue consumption absolutely necessary modern society point modern natural sciences require rapidly increasing amounts computing power molecular biology biochemistry physics climatology basically field advanced beyond fundamentals need analyze huge data sets work simulation models increasing complexity even computing example structure new chemical compounds usage medicine get computational power production computers see microcomputers rapidly replacing new much efficient see moore law generations creating new markets old ones saturated minicomputers microcomputers wearables consumption funds research development computing need progress natural sciences rely extremely efficient farming power sources medicine deal ongoing issues however plenty areas rapid progress happen efficient without hindering progress even balance consumption mentioned also social aspect entirely related consumption plenty companies make people want first place rather make people want something satisfy artificially created demand point basic assumption parties operating free markets fully informed equal way flawed companies resources much larger body knowledge psychology used manipulate consumers furthermore consumers typically earn money first order consume societies often working jobs http actually produce anything valuable keep system running keep people busy finance flowing

Anticonsumption,"&gt; ""My name is Roope Mokka. I’m a futurist...""

That explains a lot.

This article is all kinds of bad. This is exactly the kind of shallow, careless stuff I would expect to find (and hope to be contained) on /r/futurology. The whole thing is one long [deepity](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity), which is to say that to the extent that it is true it is trivial, and to the extent that it is profound it is misleading, speculative, or just false. *Some* of these things *might* be able to be explained as an example of bad translation, but most of the content of this essay is just guesswork and I'm pretty sure it was originally written in English anyway.

Some examples of the abject atrocity that is the source article:

&gt;What one needs to understand are four things:

&gt;1. Internet of NO things is already happening
&gt;2. It will inevitably change our relationship to the physical world.
&gt;3. Eventually the internet will disappear and become part of our environment
&gt;4. Nobody knows exactly how, but we know pretty certainly that it will happen somehow

Did you catch that? 

&gt;**4. Nobody knows exactly how, but we know pretty certainly that it will happen somehow**

Since this is a main point of the entire essay, the conclusions following from this flawed premise are unsupported. *How* do you know the things you're claiming? *Why* do you think this? What reasons or methods or what train of logic did you follow to get here? These are important questions, and until there is demonstrated some reason for why any of these claims are reliable or even relevant, I remain exceedingly skeptical.

&gt; ""Bits and atoms are joining. Or to be more precise, bits and megawats, everything in this world is either energy or information.""

An astounding deepity. Meaningless drivel.

&gt;3. Post-ownership society. There is no point in owning anything, in fact ownership might become just a luxury. Instead of wanting to own things we want to own data. Data that concerns us and concerns others. Data might even replace money as the medium of value.

As with the rest of the futurological predictions made, this one is just totally unfounded. There is no given reason, at all, to think that this would, could or should happen in the future. No mechanism is described for the distribution of data. How will we compare the value of data that we control and others don't if, in order to know how valuable the data is, they have to know what the data is to begin with? Unless the author is using some other definition of data than the one I'm familiar with, this just another rambling deepity.

&gt;Now what should we do, in the eve of this potentially great transformation? We have two options. We may adopt either a conservative or a progressive agenda.

&gt;* Conservative agenda. Conserve what we have with laws, regulations and incentivising

&gt;* Progressive agenda. Ask what should we do with this new technology, how can harness it, how can we use it solve the wicked problems of our age, from climate change to lifestyles diseases and segregation.

This is a false dichotomy. These are not the only two options available to us, even if we take for granted everything in the essay leading up to this point. Surely there would be some middle ground between the two options given, not to mention other possibilities entirely. 

&gt;The really amazing thing behind this is energy harvesting. The sensor will have to work without a power source. They will harvest their energy from their environment. Heat, light, movement and radio waves – these are the four things that energy will be harvested from.

&gt;This is also critical to the vision of the internet of NO things. It will either happen without energy, or it will not happen at all.

&gt;Then we’ll have pure computing power, that we’ll paint to the walls, print, use and paint them, print them, they will harvest their own energy.

The author equates ""happening without energy"" with ""powered by ambient energy."" I'm not just being pedantic when I say that the energy harvested from ambient sources mentioned isn't free or limitless. In my opinion this is the worst part of the entire article. Why is it so important that ambient energy be used as the power source for these futuristic technological integrations? Why can this technological evolution not occur without energy harvesting? There are no reasons given, merely assertions assumed by the author to be taken by the reader as fact.

And yes, while the ambient energy harvesting might work for very small scale electronics like sensors, clocks and calculators, complex computers require orders of magnitudes more energy than can readily be provided via ambient energy harvesting. Indeed, as computing computing ability goes up linearly, the area of solar panels required to power that computer goes up exponentially, not to mention the cooling requirements. These same limitations apply to distributed computing.

My final gripe with this essay is that the author seems to be tooting the horn of his organization and its electronics printing service quite a lot. I suspect that this article is an advertisement disguised as an intellectual concept. This could only appeal to those credulous, unquestioning sorts who will believe anything they hear as long as it sounds science-y enough and has enough buzzwords floating around in it. 

I have wasted too much of my own computing power nitpicking this probable advertisement, but on the upside that heat I produced in thinking and typing can now be harvested as ambient energy.",1465543316,gt name roope mokka futurist explains lot article kinds bad exactly kind shallow careless stuff would expect find hope contained whole thing one long deepity http say extent true trivial extent profound misleading speculative false things might able explained example bad translation content essay guesswork pretty sure originally written english anyway examples abject atrocity source article gt one needs understand four things gt internet things already happening gt inevitably relationship physical world gt eventually internet disappear become part environment gt nobody knows exactly know pretty certainly happen somehow catch gt nobody knows exactly know pretty certainly happen somehow since main point entire essay conclusions flawed premise unsupported know things claiming think reasons methods train logic follow get important questions demonstrated reason claims reliable even relevant remain exceedingly skeptical gt bits atoms joining precise bits megawats everything world either energy information astounding deepity meaningless drivel gt society point owning anything fact ownership might become luxury instead wanting things want data concerns us concerns others data might even replace money medium value rest futurological predictions made one totally unfounded given reason think would could happen future mechanism described distribution data compare value data control others order know valuable data know data begin unless author using definition data one familiar another rambling deepity gt eve potentially transformation two options may adopt either conservative progressive agenda gt conservative agenda conserve laws regulations incentivising gt progressive agenda ask new technology harness use solve wicked problems age lifestyles diseases segregation false dichotomy two options available us even take granted everything essay leading point surely would middle ground two options given possibilities entirely gt really amazing thing behind energy harvesting sensor work without power source harvest energy environment heat light movement radio waves four things energy harvested gt also critical vision internet things either happen without energy happen gt pure computing power paint walls print use paint print harvest energy author equates happening without energy powered ambient energy pedantic say energy harvested ambient sources mentioned free limitless opinion worst part entire article important ambient energy used power source futuristic technological integrations technological evolution occur without energy harvesting reasons given merely assertions assumed author taken reader fact ambient energy harvesting might work small scale electronics sensors clocks calculators complex computers require orders magnitudes energy readily provided via ambient energy harvesting indeed computing ability goes linearly area solar panels required power computer goes exponentially cooling requirements limitations apply distributed computing final gripe essay author seems tooting horn organization electronics printing service quite lot suspect article advertisement disguised intellectual concept could appeal credulous unquestioning sorts believe anything hear long sounds enough buzzwords floating around wasted much computing power nitpicking probable advertisement upside heat produced thinking typing harvested ambient energy

What's weird is that the principle proponents for making people work for a living are also the people who advocate reduced birth control (i.e., population explosion).

Anticonsumption,"Really the hardest thing is getting rid of that desire for stuff. It's somewhat an addiction. I mean, we all slave away at work, so why can't we buy something nice at the weekend?

Firstly, I would start minimalizing. And be serious. If you haven't used something in more than a year, it be gone! Give it away to opportunity shops/secondhand shops, or sell it if it's worth something. Give stuff to friends/family. Last resort, bin it. I hate throwing stuff away, but if no-one wants it and it's eventually going to end up in landfill anyway, then sometimes it's all you can do.

It's pretty addicting. Especially if your place is quite cluttered. Go through draws, cupboards, wardrobes, etc... See how much space you can clear. You might even find yourself clearing entire drawers, so then you can sell the drawers. It's certainly not easy getting rid of stuff (as in the effort required, not the emotional attachment). It's much easier to accumulate stuff, so just the effort of doing this gives you good incentive to not go out and buy more shit. It's also very liberating.

Secondly, find a hobby or two (if you don't already) that will hold your attention. Just be warned though, almost any hobby can be ""consumerised"", so be careful not to fall into that trap. If you want to start mountain biking for example, you don't need the most expensive, high tech bike. Just find something that interests you and that you can steer your attention and passion towards. I know some will say things like videogames can be a hobby, and I agree, it can. But I would avoid instant gratification, short attention span, overly-stimulating consumption like games and movies. It just doesn't gel with the anti-consumption mindset imo, and is often still pushing the consumption narrative. You're looking for *long term* satisfaction here, like learning a musical instrument.

Thirdly is to just be mindful of your purchases. Really think about your purchasing decisions. Even the small ones if possible, but for now just think about purchases beyond necessities like food. Eventually though you will find yourself critiquing everything you put in your supermarket trolley lol. For example; we buy bulk where we can, avoid plastic packaged food, buy local food, etc...

Beyond the above, my personal journey really has been into the nature of our world and economy. Seeing how capitalism is ultimately destructive and unsustainable. How we are accelerating climate change and resource depletion. The pollution and ravaging of the oceans and so forth. The inherent ugliness and unwholesomeness of greed and wanting more. The lack of compassion and connection between us, and how our society &amp; culture implicitly manifests this. I've also started the journey of meditation which has been hugely eye opening. These things all help to make you think of the greater impact we all have on the planet and people, and how we go about our lives. It's impossible to be perfect, so don't judge yourself too much, but just be mindful of what you can do to cut your impact.

Hope this helps.

P.S. If you haven't watch some documentaries. True Cost is a great one on the clothing industry.

Fault Lines - [Made In Bangladesh 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQGl_lswYY) 25 mins: [Fault Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_Lines_%28TV_series%29) is an Al Jazeera show that won a [Peabody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award) for this documentary.  It focuses mainly on Walmart and their impact on the garment industry.

[Crackin Films](http://www.crackinfilms.com/) - [Owned And Operated 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njSV5LtVmR4) 1hr45mins: A collection of clips assembled in a way that I think shows how silly and harmful consumerism is.  Some viewers don't seem to find it well organized, though I like it.  After the first hour it changes though and begins to introduce movements such as Anonymous and [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/), some of which seems a little lame.  Even if you don't think you'll like that part, it is well worth watching at least the first hour.

Barry Silverthorn - [The End of Suburbia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcvni4lY8mA) 1hr17Mins: This documentary focuses on (mostly USA) oil consumption and the effect that peak oil will have on the way people live.  It describes how cities developed based on cheap and fast personal transportation, and how city designs might have to change if the cost(s) of oil were to rise high enough to make suburbs financially nonviable.  A number of the clips in this film are from pre-US peak oil and help illustrate how people were convinced of the merits of suburb city design.

BBC - [The Men Who Made Us Spend 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q3eZNVK4AI&amp;list=PLTVN2x7WHPggMQYK-yh7Pcu8Kto-wjcSA) Three one hour parts: This ""Jacques Peretti Investigates"" series covers a lot of ground including Apple, the light bulb conspiracy, food, pharma, anti-aging industry, psychology of buying, child consumer recruitment, and more.

T.S. Bennett and Sally Erickson - [What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2em1x2j9-o) 2hrs3mins: This documentary is not consumerism or consumption specific but has a lot of overlap with these topics.  The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_a_Way_to_Go:_Life_at_the_End_of_Empire) describes it as ""...discusses issues such as peak oil, climate change and the effects of global warming, population overshoot and species extinction, as well as how this situation has developed."".

Science does help out in this sense, efficiencies in almost any field you care to mention have be increasing rapidly for decades, even centuries. BUT per person we are consuming more than ever, in that sense it is a psychology problem not a technology problem.

Throwing out science as a whole is just short sighted. For the most part it is used for good until business interests get involved. Look at global warming, science has provided solutions for decades but big business has kept these solutions down in favor of the lazy solutions. 

The biggest thing people can do is to get the information, education about the issues of the world can be the first step in a long a fruitful solution.

Anticonsumption,"Good question. I think it's instructional in this case to consider the difference between a personal (marginal) change and a large scale system-wide change.

From an environmental perspective, catching your own fish and hunting your own meat is far superior to anything purchased in a supermarket. I assume you're fishing with rod and line, which assures virtually no by-catch. In contrast, [bycatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bycatch) is a serious problem with industrialized ocean fishing and open pen aquaculture has its own set of [issues](http://wildfishconservancy.org/what-we-do/advocacy/net-pen-aquaculture). Many problems associated with the factory farming of animals such as blue water footprint and concentrated animal waste are complete non-issues with wild animals.

However, this is not a scalable solution. In the United States for example, it would be simply impossible to feed the entire population with meat from hunted animals and rod-and-line caught fish. I don't have a study to cite to support this, but when I ran the numbers myself it looked like hunting could sustain far less than 50% of the current population. It's a similar situation on a worldwide basis, simply because we've converted SO MUCH land to use for agriculture.

So should you, as a hunter, change your habits because of concerns about environment and climate change? Probably not. And should you, as a hunter, encourage other people to take up hunting and avoid buying meat at the supermarket? There might be some benefit there. And should you, as a hunter, put yourself in opposition with those who broadly recommend that *everyone* eat less meat? Well no, because the vast majority of meat is produced in farms, especially factory farms.

In my view there is plenty of room for hunters and environmentally-motivated vegetarians/vegans to agree that minimizing or entirely avoiding meat purchased in supermarkets and restaurants is a good plan.",1512582800,question think instructional case consider difference personal marginal large scale environmental perspective catching fish hunting meat far superior anything purchased supermarket assume fishing rod line assures virtually contrast bycatch https serious problem industrialized ocean fishing open pen aquaculture set issues http many problems associated factory farming animals blue water footprint concentrated animal waste complete wild animals however scalable solution united states example would simply impossible feed entire population meat hunted animals caught fish study cite support ran numbers looked hunting could sustain far less current population similar situation worldwide basis simply converted much land use agriculture hunter habits concerns environment probably hunter encourage people take hunting avoid buying meat supermarket might benefit hunter put opposition broadly recommend everyone eat less meat well vast majority meat produced farms especially factory farms view plenty room hunters agree minimizing entirely avoiding meat purchased supermarkets restaurants plan
Anticonsumption,"&gt; So if I move my meat consumption to exclusively local game or local free range beef and dairy (I can), is the meat I eat still harming the environment as much as the factory farmed equivalent?

Which environmental impacts are you concerned about?

- *Land Allocation* The single largest use of land in the continental United States is grassland/rangeland (about 29% of all available land) followed by forests (28%) and cropland (17%). And don't forget that much of the cropland is used to grow food for intensively farmed animals. The trouble is that expansion in one area (ie. rangeland) often comes at the expensive of another (eg. forests). Given that free range beef/dairy actually take up more land, that may not be seen as favourable if you're worried about deforestation and other land use change.

- *Water use* Cattle have the lowest ""blue"" water (aquifers/groundwater) footprint when pastured for their entire lives. Be careful about labels here, because ""free range"" and ""grass fed"" do not always mean ""100% pastured"". It's common for cattle to be pastured for the first part of their lives, then later moved into CAFOs for finishing.

- *Climate change* Some people might try to tell you that factory-farmed cattle have less impact on climate change because they live shorter lives and thus produce less methane through enteric fermentation per pound of finished meat. Frankly, that is bull shit. The practice of raising cattle contributes to climate change in a variety of ways ranging from fertilizer inputs to transportation to refrigeration and manure management, and an exclusive focus on enteric fermentation ignores these. So yes, moving away from factory farmed meat would likely make a small positive difference with regard to climate. Moving to exclusively local game would make a much larger difference.",1512584556,gt move meat consumption exclusively local game local free range beef dairy meat eat still harming environment much factory farmed equivalent environmental impacts concerned land allocation single largest use land continental united states available land forests cropland forget much cropland used grow food intensively farmed animals trouble expansion one area ie rangeland often comes expensive another eg forests given free range actually take land may seen favourable worried deforestation land use water use cattle lowest blue water footprint pastured entire lives careful labels free range grass fed always mean pastured common cattle pastured first part lives later moved cafos finishing people might try tell cattle less impact live shorter lives thus produce less methane enteric fermentation per pound finished meat frankly bull practice raising cattle contributes variety ways ranging fertilizer inputs transportation refrigeration manure management exclusive focus enteric fermentation ignores moving away factory farmed meat would likely make small positive difference regard moving exclusively local game would make much larger difference
Anticonsumption,"&gt; when buying my meat, I go to local farmers

One of the biggest benefits here is being able to talk to your local farmers. Some people think the reason to buy local is to reduce energy usage in transportation, but this can be misleading. Generally speaking around 90% of the environmental impact from purchased food comes from production and only 10% from transportation. There's a huge amount of reading and research in this area, and a shorter summary on [Wikipedia - Food Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_miles#Energy_used_in_production_as_well_as_transport). One of my favourite ways of supporting local farmers is through [CSA programs](http://www.farmfolkcityfolk.ca/resources/knowledge-pantry/csa/).

&gt; meat that hasn't been fed antibiotics its whole life

This is a good kind of question to ask local farmers. Sometimes meat or dairy might be labelled ""free of antibiotics"" but that only means that a waiting period has been observed, not that antibiotics were never used. Being able to ask your farmer whether she/he uses antibiotics is a good way to avoid confusion in labelling.

&gt; Also assume that the amount of meat consumption is a constant.

I would encourage you to re-evaluate this position, especially in light of the fact that we're discussing this in /r/anticonsumption. But for the sake of discussion I'll accept this premise.

&gt; that the meat I use takes up more land than factory farms

Unless we're talking about game animals, in which case the land ""use"" is basically zero since wild animals coexists with many other species in habitats that are more diverse than what you'd see on a farm.

&gt; the meat I use also has less of an impact because of the lack of antibiotics

Yeah that's fair to say, keeping in mind the caveat mentioned above about labelling tricks.

&gt; And then I am correct that overall, this is an improvement for my personal ecological impact, but unsustainable when scaled and therefore not viable for the greater population?

Yes, that's pretty much the gist of it. I think when talking about environmental or ecological impact it's important to consider how climate change is a different sort of problem. Climate change is a global issue and therefore demands solutions at a global scale. Although there are benefits to obtaining meat from either hunting or local free range farms, neither of those work as global solutions. On the other hand, it is widely known that reducing meat consumption (in favour of nutrition from legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains, etc.) is one important strategy in our portfolio of ways to deal with climate change on a global scale. If you're curious, [the Drawdown Project](http://www.drawdown.org/solutions) has prepared an amazingly well-researched portfolio of solutions for dealing with climate change. Some are personal, while others are industrial/political.

Anticonsumption,"There's plenty of reason to be cynical, but I consider holding onto revolutionary hope to be a discipline. Giving up will ensure we lose, so the only option is to fight.

Fortunately for us, we know that capitalism's internal contradictions inevitably lead to major crises, and if we've prepared for it we can take advantage of them when they come. The vanguard needs to stand out as an effective, credible revolutionary force with a clear vision and ability to lead out of the crisis, in Trotsky's words it is the ""party of revolutionary hope"" counter to the fascist response of despair. People will become convinced of the need for socialism because of their material conditions in times of crisis when liberal explanations are obviously false and cannot offer relief, but only if we are there to give shape to what they are experiencing. Much of the military may swing to our side in a severe crisis, or at least refuse to kill us, since they are also members of the proletariat.

To be clear, although we should work within the system in the meantime, we should be making immediate demands like ""rent control now"" (in Ginger Jentzen's campaign in Minneapolis), linked to national demands like ""housing for all,"" which we argue require further demands (such as Socialist Alternative's call to place all Fortune 500 companies under democratic control) which we know are impossible without revolutionary force. We know revolution will be necessary eventually, in the meantime we grow class consciousness by fighting for immediate, bold demands, and showing in real time who and what stands in our way (i.e. capitalism). That's also why Trots are always selling newspapers, we have to have a clear voice in addition to winning victories and organizing.

Anticonsumption,"I think one part in attempting to lower consumption or production is thinking about why we need so much production, and how/why consumption is so hailed and nearly forced upon people by ads from companies. Of course, the companies need and want money. We should look why there are companies raking in millions each year and trying to make profits, and we should look how consumption and company greed plays a role in that. We would surely see that how much is consumed and how much money was generated in a year isn't only seen as a means to judge companies, but also countries and the system in general, and how wealthy countries or states seem to be. A conclusion would surely be that it's all significantly tied to capitalism, its economic cycle and worsening crises, and our society being encouraged more and more to consume more to make up for the crises. That is also why at least some governments make efforts in subsidizing certain things (like buying a car and getting money for your old car in return, good loans, ..) in a crisis to encourage consumption and taking up loans. Capitalism itself needs continuous growth to be sustained, but that is actually not sustainable - not the nature, not the resources, not the prices, nothing of it. I think capitalism is a factor in lots of consumption and therefore production, in an attempt to keep up the system, especially financially. The glorification of consumption aids that. If we want to stop it, we'd either have to rethink parts of capitalism, but realistically, we'd probably have to find and adopt another system entirely. 

The problem with that is finding a consensus on what system that should be, and to even convince people literally making millions and billions off of capitalism and how it works to stop exploiting people and our resources for their own gain. In our system, money also means power, and if you starve people of enough money or make them work more and more for it, there's not gonna be enough energy or means left to mobilize against that. We're gonna increasingly run into a society that paralyzes its people from standing up against that stuff. 

The following attempt is more folk politics/localism/horizontalism-like, but I feel like the best we can do for now as an immediate thing we can do individually, is to check our own consumption (even though no consumption under capitalism is ethical), educate others around us, share documentaries and other informative things highlighting the consequences of our mindless consumption, trying to support companies/organizations/startups/whatever that are particularly cautious of environmental effects and packaging and focus more on usefulness, moderation, ""organic"" stuff, etc. , supporting policies that would help (like countries that ban parts of packaging, plastic bags, maybe even switch to better packaging...) or engaging yourself politically even just locally to make (or attempt) a difference for your city and area. We also need to stand up against extreme exploitation of people, resources and land under capitalism; as well as go against powerful people still negating climate change and other negative environmental factors by our consumption. 

We can dismantle ads and create public discussion about some of the stuff we see or how overflowing the ads have become, and create a culture of awareness around ads. I feel like we desperately, in a big scale discussion, need to talk about how ads persuade us into buying things we don't need, with money we don't necessarily have, because it tells us it could or will fill a void that was created by other factors in our every day life in this system.

Anticonsumption,"Well.. Here is another text: https://crimethinc.com/2014/12/10/why-break-windows

I think they are great to at least give an insight in the politics behind vandalism. 

Because y'all probably won't read the texts.. I'll shortly summarize, here are some key quotes from the first text *You are not the target audience*: 

* Property destruction is not violence in any substantive sense. To use the same term for vandalism as direct physical brutality is an Orwellian pollution of language that cheapens real violence and suggests that people are equivalent to things.

* Similarly, masking up is not just useful when it comes to filtering chemical irritants but also a good way to avoid persecution.

* All that’s holding them (potential allies) back from joining in active resistance is a sense of isolation, weakness, and despair. In this context street fighting and vandalism are not so much proofs of method but statements of commitment and seriousness. There are others like you who are willing to fight, and we can hurt them, or at the very least we can shatter the air of invulnerability that pervades business as usual.

* That’s why politicians and police consistently go apeshit over things like measly storefront windows. Their control is dependent in no small part on being seen as in control. Certain boundaries to what’s considered feasible must be secured at all cost lest they begin to lose the illusion of invulnerability that dissuades the subjugated from rising up. 

From the second text *Why break windows?* 

* .. property destruction is an effective tactic. From the Boston Tea Party to the demonstrations against the 1999 World Trade Organization summit in Seattle

* Shop windows represent segregation. They are invisible barriers. Like so much in this society, they simultaneously offer a view of “the good life” and block access to it. [..] To smash a shop window is to contest all the boundaries that cut through this society: black and white, rich and poor, included and excluded.

* Gentrification and vandalism are both forms of intervention in the urban landscape—the difference is that gentrification is top-down, while vandalism is bottom-up.

* Businesses, be they multinational or local, are the tax base that pays for police, and without police they would not be able to accumulate so much wealth at everyone else’s expense. 

*  In the final analysis, sabotage and arson are the strategy of a retreating army—of those who know they will not hold a given terrain for long. A movement strong enough to retain the territory it seizes from the police wouldn’t need to break or burn anything, only to transform it. 

And as I said, fuck McDonalds in particular. That company is responsible for millions of slaughtered and tortured animals. Anything done to McDonalds' objects is justified.

If a person really is against this type of waste. Why would they continue to buy it. There are other options. Hell with this product you can buy large cardboard canisters of the powder, save money, packaging and make it in your own reusable containers.  So it looks to others that these post are either oblivious or karma whoring.

Anticonsumption,"Let's flip the idea on its head and talk about a sort of ""growth ray"". If you had the ability to scale up your food/toiletries/belongings such that your inventory could last much longer, and doing so didn't harm a soul, would you?

 I absolutely would, and I think it is important to talk about making essentials like food and toiletries cheaper, not by screwing people in the line of production, but by maximizing efficiency of production and reducing waste in general. I'm talking most specifically about food in this case, since so much food is lost every year around the globe because of poor and unpredictable environmental conditions, rodents/pests, ridiculously stringent cosmetic standards (which cause the ugly produce to be mulched back into the ground), and eventually consumer negligence that leads to spoiled food. We can absolutely downsize our *consumption* without necessarily losing any comfort in doing so, just by maximizing what we have and refusing to let it spoil/go to waste. 

The movie's concept is interesting because it suggests that (at least from what you tell me, I haven't seen it) downsizing will reduce the problems associated with climate change and overpopulation. But this is true in the real world as well. If we do our best to close the distance between our living establishments and our places of work, if we shrink our houses down to exactly the size we need, if we scale down amount of food and items we buy, and if we buy our products locally when possible, then our downsizing is having the same effect of reducing climate change.

Here's a quote from that page:

How does animal agriculture cause global warming?

&gt; On of the main ways in which the livestock sector contributes to global warming is through deforestation caused by expansion of pasture land and arable land used to grow feedcrops.  Overall, animal agriculture is responsible for about 9% of human-caused carbon dioxideemissions globally (UN FAO).

&gt; Animal agriculture is also a significant source of other greenhouse gases.  For example, ruminant animals like cattle produce methane, which is a greenhouse gas about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  The livestock sector is responsible for about 37% of human-caused methane emissions, and about 65% of human nitrous oxide emissions (mainly from manure), globally (UN FAO).

You see you're only counting direct GHG but deforestation and alike contribute huge amounts of GHG by preventing GHG sinks.

And perhaps most importantly in the second paragraph of the quote, methane is 20x more potent, so even though the GHG tonnes are similar, animal agriculture is significantly worse in GHG alone, then add deforest station to the mix, as well as the fact living without modern transport is nigh impossible but being vegan is easy, I think it's an easy choice.",1529430272,looking us break refers entire world shipping us country world bro look break shipping rail shipping transport roads automobiles air planes mean literally right know see quote page animal agriculture cause gt main ways livestock sector contributes deforestation caused expansion pasture land arable land used grow feedcrops overall animal agriculture responsible carbon dioxideemissions globally un fao gt animal agriculture also significant source greenhouse gases example ruminant animals cattle produce methane greenhouse gas times potent carbon dioxide livestock sector responsible methane emissions human nitrous oxide emissions mainly manure globally un fao see counting direct ghg deforestation alike contribute huge amounts ghg preventing ghg sinks perhaps importantly second paragraph quote methane potent even though ghg tonnes similar animal agriculture significantly worse ghg alone add deforest station mix well fact living without modern transport nigh impossible vegan easy think easy choice

Fat shaming is a false equivalence. Shaming someone for their body type, race, sexual orientation or gender identity is making someone feel shameful for traits about themselves that they cannot help. People should feel shameful for shameful behavior though. If someone is a homophobic asshole, they should be ashamed of themselves. If a CEO of a corporation lobbies or bribes a government or government official to keep polluting a river, they should feel ashamed of themselves. If someone is making animals suffer, causing global warming, and damaging their own health by eating animal products and they feel shame when it is pointed out to them- the feeling of shame is appropriate.

And there is a lot of evidence it’s working. People are ashamed of being ‘politically incorrect’ and it has driven a lot of unacceptable behavior underground.

Anticonsumption,"I didn't realize I was trying to convince anyone of anything; I was just trying to answer your question. Didn't realize it would end up being a debate -- but, here are a few other things to consider (which I borrowed from this link, because they say it better than I can: https://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/mock-meat-shakedown-are-plant-based-meats-healthy/ )

Genetically Modified Soy: In recent years, the threat of GMOs has been ringing more loudly and clear than ever before. And soy is one of the leaders of the pack, right up there on the front line with corn. If it’s not organic and/or verified as non-GMO, then the soy — soy protein concentrate or isolate — that makes up the bulk of your cuisine is most likely genetically modified, bringing with it numerous health threats.

Too Much Sodium: Yes, you need some salt, but frozen foods are notorious for raking in high amounts of sodium, and frozen meat substitutes are no exception, especially those soy-based options. For example:

A serving size of Boca’s crumbles contains 270mg of sodium.
Boca’s Vegan—made with non-GMO soy—Burger packs 470mg of sodium.
The lesson here is simple. Even if it looks good as far as GMOs go, it’s important to assess the amount of sodium in comparison to the serving size.

------
Last points I have to share: 

- Eating lots of fake meats isn't much better for you than eating any other processed foods you'd find in the frozen section of the grocery store (for the reasons listed above, for starters). Compared to eating whole foods (fruits, veggies; etc) fake meats aren't necessarily healthier than other non-veg/vegan foods. So, if you're eating them to be ""healthier"" than eating a regular diet that includes meat, it's not really that much healthier. 

- If you're eating fake meats to impact the environment less, you're not really helping as much as you'd hope to. Soy farming contributes greatly to climate change by increasing carbon emissions, it contributes to the destruction of rainforests, and creates dangerous chemical runoff from pesticides that leach into freshwater and groundwater and contaminate it.

Anticonsumption,"I share your feelings and am currently researching this issue i found this site through r/collapse which has an interesting article on the ladder of awareness which is copied below https://www.paulchefurka.ca/

Climbing the Ladder of Awareness

When it comes to our understanding of the unfolding global crisis, each of us seems to fit somewhere along a continuum of awareness that can be roughly divided into five stages:

    Dead asleep. At this stage there seem to be no fundamental problems, just some shortcomings in human organization, behaviour and morality that can be fixed with the proper attention to rule-making. People at this stage tend to live their lives happily, with occasional outbursts of annoyance around election times or the quarterly corporate earnings seasons.

    Awareness of one fundamental problem. Whether it's Climate Change, overpopulation, Peak Oil, chemical pollution, oceanic over-fishing, biodiversity loss, corporatism, economic instability or sociopolitical injustice, one problem seems to engage the attention completely. People at this stage tend to become ardent activists for their chosen cause. They tend to be very vocal about their personal issue, and blind to any others.

    Awareness of many problems. As people let in more evidence from different domains, the awareness of complexity begins to grow.  At this point a person worries about the prioritization of problems in terms of their immediacy and degree of impact. People at this stage may become reluctant to acknowledge new problems - for example, someone who is committed to fighting for social justice and against climate change may not recognize the problem of resource depletion.  They may feel that the problem space is already complex enough, and the addition of any new concerns will only dilute the effort that needs to be focused on solving the ""highest priority"" problem.

    Awareness of the interconnections between the many problems. The realization that a solution in one domain may worsen a problem in another marks the beginning of large-scale system-level thinking. It also marks the transition from thinking of the situation in terms of a set of problems to thinking of it in terms of a predicament. At this point the possibility that there may not be a solution begins to raise its head.

    People who arrive at this stage tend to withdraw into tight circles of like-minded individuals in order to trade insights and deepen their understanding of what's going on. These circles are necessarily small, both because personal dialogue is essential for this depth of exploration, and because there just aren't very many people who have arrived at this level of understanding.

    Awareness that the predicament encompasses all aspects of life.  This includes everything we do, how we do it, our relationships with each other, as well as our treatment of the rest of the biosphere and the physical planet. With this realization, the floodgates open, and no problem is exempt from consideration or acceptance. The very concept of a ""Solution"" is seen through, and cast aside as a waste of effort.

For those who arrive at Stage 5 there is a real risk that depression will set in. After all, we've learned throughout our lives that our hope for tomorrow lies in  our ability to solve problems today.  When no amount of human cleverness appears able to solve our predicament the possibility of hope can vanish like a the light of a candle flame, to be replaced by the suffocating darkness of despair.

How people cope with despair is of course deeply personal, but it seems to me there are two general routes people take to reconcile themselves with the situation.  These are not mutually exclusive, and most of us will operate out of some mix of the two.  I identify them here as general tendencies, because people seem to be drawn more to one or the other.  I call them the outer path and the inner path.

If one is inclined to choose the outer path, concerns about adaptation and local resilience move into the foreground, as exemplified by the Transition Network and Permaculture Movement. To those on the outer path, community-building and local sustainability initiatives will have great appeal.  Organized party politics seems to be less attractive to people at this stage, however.  Perhaps politics is seen as part of the problem, or perhaps it's just seen as a waste of effort when the real action will take place at the local level.

If one is disinclined to choose the outer path either because of temperament or circumstance, the inner path offers its own set of attractions.

Choosing the inner path involves re-framing the whole thing in terms of consciousness, self-awareness and/or some form of transcendent perception.  For someone on this path it is seen as an attempt to manifest Gandhi's message, ""Become the change you wish to see in the world,"" on the most profoundly personal level.  This message is similarly expressed in the ancient Hermetic saying, ""As above, so below."" Or in plain language,  ""In order to heal the world, first begin by healing yourself.""

However, the inner path does not imply a ""retreat into religion"". Most of the people I've met who have chosen an inner path have as little use for traditional religion as their counterparts on the outer path have for traditional politics.  Organized religion is usually seen as part of the predicament rather than a valid response to it. Those who have arrived at this point have no interest in hiding from or easing the painful truth, rather they wish to create a coherent personal context for it. Personal spirituality of one sort or another often works for this, but organized religion rarely does.

It's worth mentioning that there is also the possibility of a serious personal difficulty at this point.  If someone cannot choose an outer path for whatever reasons, and is also resistant to the idea of inner growth or spirituality as a response the the crisis of an entire planet, then they are truly in a bind. There are few other doorways out of this depth of despair.  If one remains stuck here for an extended period of time, life can begin to seem awfully bleak, and violence against either the world or oneself may begin begin to seem like a reasonable option.  Keep a watchful eye on your own progress, and if you encounter someone else who may be in this state, please offer them a supportive ear.

From my observations, each successive stage contains roughly a tenth of the number people as the one before it. So while perhaps 90% of humanity is in Stage 1, less than one person in ten thousand will be at Stage 5 (and none of them are likely to be politicians).  The number of those who have chosen the inner path in Stage 5 also seems to be an order of magnitude smaller than the number who are on the outer path.

I happen to have chosen an inner path as my response to a Stage 5 awareness. It works well for me, but navigating this imminent (transition, shift, metamorphosis - call it what you will), will require all of us - no matter what our chosen paths - to cooperate on making wise decisions in difficult times.

Best wishes for a long, exciting and fulfilling  journey.

Anticonsumption,"If the whole planet were vegan, we would use less land, less water, emit less methane/carbon dioxide, and destroy fewer habitats. 

&gt;Marco Springmann, a research fellow at the Oxford Martin School’s Future of Food programme, tried to quantify just how much better: he and his colleagues built computer models that predicted what would happen if everyone became vegetarian by 2050. The results indicate that – largely thanks to the elimination of red meat – food-related emissions would drop by about 60%. If the world went vegan instead, emissions declines would be around 70%.

...

&gt;Should we all go vegetarian, ideally we would dedicate at least 80% of that pastureland to the restoration of grasslands and forests, which would capture carbon and further alleviate climate change. Converting former pastures to native habitats would likely also be a boon to biodiversity, including for large herbivores such as buffalo that were pushed out for cattle, as well as for predators like wolves that are often killed in retaliation for attacking livestock.

&gt;The remaining 10 to 20% of former pastureland could be used for growing more crops to fill gaps in the food supply. Though a relatively small increase in agricultural land, this would more than make up for the loss of meat because one-third of the land currently used for crops is dedicated to producing food for livestock – not for humans.

...

&gt;One study found that simply conforming to the World Health Organization’s dietary recommendations would bring the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions down by 17% – a figure that would drop by an additional 40% should citizens further avoid animal products and processed snacks.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; most of the burden of sustainable decisions is on the consumer.

I fundamentally disagree with you in every way. Most of the history of the worlds environmental damage has been caused by companies and the people who own them. 

There are some responsibilities the consumer has, and only two ways in which that can change their habits to actually make a sizeable difference in environmental damage (going Vegan and riding your bike for basic daily commutes) 

Outside of that recycling every time, taking showers once a week, using reusable items as much as possible, avoiding food products and instead just getting regular food etc etc will not substantially decrease your environmental cost. Combined it's less than switching to a vegetarian only diet but not fully vegan. 

The people of the world hold very little responsibility for environmental destruction and climate change. It's the choices of large corporations and the wanton excesses of the wealthy that has put us into this situation.

Anticonsumption,"Quite literally, if even a small majority vote with their dollars in unison governments and markets feel the impact. Of course those who are impoverished or ignorant have no power from this perspective, I am not referring to them, I am referring to everyone else.

&gt; It wasn't purchasers who asked companies to make this shit, nor to pollute rivers, nor to pollute air. Most consumers simply don't have all the facts about any one given product, and it is literally impossible for any one person to have all the facts about all products. 

Not directly, but the desire to always consume and acquire more stuff for less money produces this result. They don't have the facts about the products because they do not demand them, and they don't demand them because they don't care. 

There is more things the non-impoverished can do than just boycott bad practices. For starters they can just consume less, or switch to a brand that does less destruction or treats it's employees better, use second hand goods, share with each other, grow their own food where applicable, produce their own power where applicable, drive less, etc etc. If it becomes known that people are switching brands or consuming less because of these reasons it compels market forces to compete in these new areas. It takes large numbers to do this, numbers which I believe are growing steadily. 

&gt; Ethical consumption under capitalism is impossible

I don't particularly think Capitalism is still the way to go, but I do believe this statement is just flat out wrong. Extremely difficult? Highly unlikely? Sure, but not impossible. The economy is a reflection of the average, the average simply don't care enough to change themselves.

Anticonsumption,"Of course! Synthetic clothes are produced by combining various chemicals and dyes, many of which have been linked to birth defects, cancer, hormone disruption, or simply have not been well tested enough to know what long-term effects they have on our health. During the production process, thousands of gallons of wastewater and pounds of gas emissions laden with these chemicals are released into the surrounding communities (usually in poor neighborhoods of developing countries, where most clothes are produced), jeopardizing their health and safety. But even though it may not be *our* local river that’s brown with sludge, we all feel the effects of this pollution in the form of global warming, a lack of clean water, and smoggy air. When we wear these items, these chemicals are absorbed by our skin. Additionally, synthetic materials trap moisture against the skin and can result in rashes, fungus, etc. I personally have what I call “itch attacks,” an allergic reaction not soothed by any cream which results in a deep, burning itch so hot, prickly, and painful that I nearly gouge out my skin trying to escape the feeling. I also stink 👀. When I wear cotton, linen, or any other natural material (rayon, viscose, modal, etc are all synthetic even thought they come from plants), my skin can breathe, I  don’t itch, and I smell just fine. Every time we launder something, tiny particles of it and are washed into our water supply. With synthetic fabrics, these particles will never disappear completely, only photo degrading (breaking down in the light) into smaller and smaller pieces that end up inside of aquatic creatures and us humans, too, poisoning us. Natural materials, on the other hand, are able to break down completely. I like to buy secondhand natural clothing because most items that are sold new have been made with plants that have beeb treated with chemicals just as dangerous as those in synthetic clothing (unless you look for organic and all that, which is more expensive). The older the item, the more time it has had to wash away those toxic chemicals. You can still get the looks you like without requiring new synthetic or even natural materials to be produced, and you can buy from brands with questionable morals but unquestionable style without supporting the sweatshop labor or pollution behind these items (what can I say? Gap stuff is cute) Plus, it’s usually cheaper and more durable since it made it long enough to worn a second time around. I hope this helped!!

Anticonsumption,"If you avoid animal products not only do fewer animals die, not only do fewer humans suffer serious physical and mental injury, often developing PTSD if they survive, not only is the impact on the climate substantially lower, not only will human health and lifespans increase, but fewer plants die as well. 

Not just from the environmental devastation inherent in raising animals as food, but because the average American consumes 1/3 of a cow, 1 pig, over 100 chickens, and over 100 fish per year as part of their diet. These animals must eat dramatically more plant matter to grow from infancy to adulthood than would a human being need to sustain their healthy life. Roughly 7 times as much. 

So if you believe all things are imbued with a spirit, and that having a spirit is equal to sentience in terms of ethical calculation - you have no choice but to go vegan. And you can take it one step further. You can adapt Jianist principles to avoid eating any plants that you must cause serious harm to. No root vegetables, mostly fruit which naturally falls from the tree, which harvesting does not bring harm to. 

Because not only does a carnist diet directly kill living sentient animals, in horrific conditions (99% of animals raised as food are raised in factory farms) but you're also killing more plants directly by clearing forests to grow crops to harvest and feed to aniamls, and indirectly by advancing climate change. 

Animal agriculture is responsible for more emissions than transportation, but because it is also the leading cause of deforestation and habitat destruction (to grow more food for more animals,) the leading cause of ocean acidification and deadzones through waste runoff (animal waste isn't treated, it's stored in huge lakes, and orders of magnitude more waste is produced by farmed animals than all the humans in all the world,) it is the leading cause of climate change. Because unlike other sources of pollution it both directly emits and directly reduces the ability of the planet to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Now we're going around in circles. As I've stated, I believe all things have consciousness. If killing animals for food - no matter the way it's done - is unethical, then so is killing plants, and at that point, we might as well just kill ourselves because we can't apparently even feed ourselves ethically. 

You can reduce the total number of things killed for your diet by going vegan. Substantially. By an order of magnitude at least. 

&gt;. I think this is ridiculous,

I think it's ridiculous to a) suggest that causing harm to something incapable of feeling pain is equal to causing harm to something capable of feeling pain and b) as a result choosing to harm more of both categories. 

Additionally, you can eat some plant foods without harming the plants. Like fruit. 

&gt;we are no different than other animals who also kill in order to survive. 

We are different from both carnivores and 'true' omnivores in that we do not require the consumption of animals to survive. We are different in that we have a different relationship to ethics and morality that relates to our increased sense of self. Some species of animals exclusively rape in order to reproduce. Some through a process called 'traumatic insemination' where the male stabs the female with his penis, to ejaculate directly inside of her. Many male animals will consume their young. Some female animals kill any male they have sex with

I don't see you suggesting that we emulate that behaviour. At least I'd certainly hope not.

See by not participating in that behaviour, and in general not randomly threatening or assaulting people you don't like, you're choosing to live to a higher ethical standard than our animal cousins. Our diet is no different. 

&gt;I have someone in my life who has to be on a strict no-starch, no-sugar, no-carbohydrate diet with limited legumes but has intense caloric and protein needs. If they cut out animal products they would literally only be able to eat leafy vegetables, fruit and nuts, and would quickly be non-functional.

What health condition do they have that evidently makes them unable to eat carbohydrates? Be specific. However some people actually survive on only vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Raw vegans are a group that exists. As are fruitarians. 

&gt;That is simply ridiculous. Human beings are omnivorous animals. Simply eating what we are designed by nature to eat is not putting ourselves at the top of anything

1) Nature is not a person. Nature did not design us to do anything. Do not personify nature nor romanticize evolution. 

We are omnivores of opportunity. We are able to obtain nutrients from animal products. There is no biological necessity to do so. Do not conflate ability with need. 

Asserting that our taste pleasure, the joy we get out of consuming the flesh of animals is more important than their lives is putting ourselves above them. Choosing a wantonly destructive diet that is advancing climate change and driving extinction of other species solely because we like the way the flesh of a cow tastes is nothing **but** putting ourselves above nature. 

&gt;You don't seem to be able to deal with this simple fact of reality, but there it is. 

Lol, you don't seem to be able to respond to anything I've said, and instead just assert weird truisms about your beliefs. Maybe don't be so condescending. 'I can't cause zero death so I should choose to multiple the death I cause for no real reason' is a completely psychopathic position to take. 

&gt;Do you go around calling a lion unethical for eating a gazelle? 
&gt;Or a polypore mushroom unethical for feeding off a tree? 
&gt;Or a fig tree unethical for consuming wasps in order to produce its fruit?

Would you call a male human unethical if he ate his children? 

What of a human who makes a living deceiving elderly people out of their life savings? (i.e. feeding off them, without outright killing them)


What about a human who consumed any man that impregnated her?

I'm sure you won't actually answer those because they evaporate your argument. Human ethical norms are not the same as those of feral animals. Our ethics **is not and ought not** be based on the chosen behaviours of wild animals. We have an additional capacity for self-awareness, and most importantly, we have the ability to choose not to cause harm. Choosing to cause harm that you don't need to cause is always unethical.

Anticonsumption,"The fact that the CHANGE IN THE RATE OF GROWTH has slowed down somewhat from the early decades when we first starting distributing vaccines &amp; medicines to 3rd world countries, doesn't mean that population growth is declining in any way. On the contrary, we're still in a population explosion. That's what I mean by saying you don't understand calculus. 

You don't seem to understand that we are in a high growth period. Now, we're at about 7B people. In 2050, that will be nearly 10B people. So discussing using plastic straws &amp; making a smaller footprint, which won't even get current pollution under any realistic control, is completely irrelevant. Conservation measures that don't entail a significant cultural change like the elimination of entire industries that are unnecessary for survival, like sports, music, TV-movies, fashion &amp; recreational &amp; personal vehicles, won't cut pollution (or climate change) enough to even keep up with the projected population growth in the next few decades.

&gt;  A lot of Redditors love pulling out the population scapegoat whenever there is an article or discussion re: environmentalism.

You keep using the phrase ""the population scapegoat"". I hope you realize this makes you sound like a capitalist economic growth or Catholic religious anti-reproductive health care conservative shill.

&gt; then you must also be aware of how capitalism stresses our environment regardless of population size. 

No, no I'm not. I'm not a socialist or anti-capitalist. But that statement is just false. Capitalists have come to rely upon population growth &amp; some amount of inflation for long term economic growth given the economic &amp; monetary systems we depend upon. And there's nothing pro-environment, either implicitly or explicitly, about capitalism.

&gt; many developed countries already have fertility rates lower than replacement levels

Not when you count migration into those countries. And that's a generalization fallacy. Look, there are cities in Africa, I'm sure, whose populations are declining for various local reasons. That doesn't mean you can use that to claim population growth in Africa is falling. 

______

You don't seem to want to admit that current levels of conservation which are ineffective at preventing the explosion of plastics in the sea from soon outweighing the mass of fish and other pollution &amp; climate change impact when we're at the 7B people population level, certainly won't keep up with pollution &amp; climate change population growth when we've escalated to 9.5-10B people by 2050. And those numbers do represent a global population explosion, no matter what you want to claim with misunderstood ideas and bad calculus. That's a population increase of some 40% during the next few decades.

We would have to cut our current per-capita pollution &amp; climate change footprint by over 40% just to keep the same rate of pollution &amp; not improve it, given the population growth over the next few decades.

I personally don't see any practical way this could be enforced. If someone reproduces without having the proper credits, how could they be penalized in any humane way?

Unfortunately, despite the fact that many humans (at this point in history) have free will and the ability to choose whether to reproduce or not, nature will ultimately be stepping in to exercise control over the population in the coming decades, if nothing changes; and nature does not care about what is ""humane"". Global warming will cause crop failures, which will cause starvation, then disease, then death.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Functionally your 'far left' is an irradiated wasteland here, and I mean no disrespect

You're not wrong. Something a lot of liberal centrists and right wingers often don't remember or recollect is that in the middle of the prior century our government made it illegal to be a communist. A lot of jokes get made that you have to force people to be communists, but little is really acknowledged that the American government took an extremely authoritarian step of banning membership in the communist party, and it had the FBI surveillance, influence to suicide, harass, beat, and sometimes assassinate communist political leaders. The most famous name on that list is Martin Luther King. 

My generation is really rebuilding from the ground up a leftist movement reflective of the 21st century, and I do think within the next 2 decades we will see a lot of change on that front. I really hope so anyway, there is some promise. I would call this, currently, counter cultural though to be clear lol.

&gt; I'd rather call you a rival-ally than anything else.

And I'm fine with that. I've no problem working with other people when we share similar goals, but I've also got no problem being clear about the fact that I refuse to work with someone toward a goal I do not support. I won't compromise myself by, for example, supporting ICE or border walls or 'regular order' in the face of a fascist wave. 

Where liberal individuals want to improve access to healthcare, I say great lets make sure it's universal, let's build it as a single payer system. This serves both the people, and the financial interests of the nation as it will reduce our current national medical bills by 50-70% if done correctly. And that includes reproductive healthcare. And that includes, something not often in current American discourse, but decades ago settled elsewhere - healthcare for our transgender siblings. They shouldn't have to accumulate two downpayments for a house to get their medically necessary procedures covered. 

Where liberal individuals want to ensure access to education I say great, lets abolish locality based funding for primary and secondary education, collect and disperse funding at the national level to each school district on a per capita basis, with additional programs providing further assistance to those in need on a need based basis. Let's also ensure post secondary education is tuition and fee free for everyone that wants to enrich their lives. 

When liberal individuals want to ensure that workers have adequate wages, I say hell yes. Lets democratize the workforce, strengthen unions, give workers control over their conditions. Let's end workplace tyranny and give our siblings the tools they need to live a life of dignity. 

Whel liberal individuals want to combat climate change I say let's start today because we're already running late. Let's raise a temporary tax with all funds dedicated to building a national clean energy grid. Let's subsidize rooftop solar panels on a basis of income, so that every structure in the US can be passively adding to the grid. Let's fund energy storage technologies to make our grid robust and resilient. Let's work to eliminate our use of living sentient animals as food sources in an incredibly inefficient and wasteful agriculture model and shift to eating more plants, or lab made meats for those who do not wish to abandon the practice entirely. 

Liberals have a lot in common with the left, from my perspective of course it seems like there's more in common with the left than the right, though through history they have generally leaned the other way when pressed. 


&gt;People, independents primarily, will not move instantaneously to your position, 

I'm not sure that's true. I think independents hear the message of left populism very strongly, that's why a guy like Bernie really touched a lot of independent voters in a way that Clinton did not. I respect your perspective, but I think it matters more that we work together on goals than that we split hairs about which message rings louder. 

&gt;I disagree on the semantics or purpose for them, but, every success you get will be well deserved and helpful to us both.

I agree with a lot of that. We actually have shared goals. We can accomplish them together. Solidarity is the spirit that runs through leftist thought, and I am always eager to show it, to our least fortunate siblings, and those of us trying to change the world for the better Move our species forward. 

Because we're at an important point in our history. Assuming you're under 40 and in good health you will live to see a day when human labour is no longer necessary to capital. For the first time in history the wealthy will not need the poor to grow their grain, bake their bread, mine their gold, or guard their kingdom. They will not need the poor to conscript themselves to fight foreign resource wars, to police the other poor in aim of maintaining a particular order, or for any other purpose. We will go from disposable in specific to disposable in aggregate. Very quickly. 

And then it will be too late to make change. When riots will not be met with human police with at least some pretending of humanity, but machines mounted with guns that feel nothing and execute. When work cannot be found, and the rich don't have to fear that you'll break into their homes because their drones will take care of that sort of thing. We will find out just how little our government is by and for the people when the people are no longer necessary. 

We have maybe 30 years to change society from one that values profit and grants 'net worth' on the basis of accumulated wealth to one that values people and deems that all have the same worth and value. The good news is that 30 years offers us 10,000 chances to get it right. The bad news is that we're starting behind the 8 ball because the generations before us did not have the foresight to plan for this inevitable problem of their creation.

Anticonsumption,"I'm looking for career advice and found this post by googling. My situation is very different from yours, but my brother is also studying marketing and while he's more mainstream liberal than actual leftist and doesn't seem to face the dilemma you face, I have thought about how one could make use of these skills for the betterment of humanity. Maybe it's a bit late, but maybe what I have to say still has some value for you.
Sorry if my message comes across a bit clumsy, English is not my native language.

First thing is the volunteering aspect. Many NGOs rely heavily on volunteer work and are not able to pay their staff that much. As a consequence, much of their advertising material is pretty shit, because nobody even thought about how this new flyer might be viewed by an average person from their target group, but just see it from their own perspective.
Or, if you prefer a more leftist take: Good propaganda needs hard work and experience.

Secondly if you're into maths, statistics is a big thing that is also needed in marketing. For example, from a statistical point of view, the MBTI is a pretty bad personality test (read the wiki article, if you want to know more). This statistics thing is very useful for a bunch of stuff on the leftist agenda, even apart from marketing - like planning the economy (if you're the kind of leftist, who wants to replace the wasteful anarchy of production with efficient, but not oppressive central planning) or democracy by sortition (again, wiki article, but you may also want to look into the book ""Against Elections - A Case for Democracy"" if interested).

If we're gonna achieve any meaningful change (in the sense of climate change and survival of the human race, not in the sense of alievating human suffering and pushing for good old social democracy in the short term, which of course is also important, but still) in the next couple of decades, we're gonna need a bunch of experts, who are on our side politically, but also know how to do the actual difficult work to run the society (not in a ""after the revolution"" way, but to make decent proposals, conceive of an alternative and break the neoliberal blockade in people's minds), not just a mass of politically conscious amateurs printing flyers and chanting.

After the Bolsheviks took power in Russia a little more than 100 years ago, they took the families of a huge number of Tsarist government bureaucrats hostage and threatened to kill them to force the bureaucrats, who were rather well off and opposed to the revolution, to keep running everything. Otherwise the cities would have come to standstill, from new food being brought in to the sewers being maintained. Keep in mind here I'm not talking about the actual workers on the ground, but the people doing the managing.

So if you're a white collar worker, an expert on something, you hold radical leftist beliefs and are organised in any way (union, party, whatever), maybe you will be needed for some really important work in 20-30 years. If you do some volunteering on the side, maybe donate some money, that's definitely better than just being depressed (which is of course very understandable) and not caring about your career, because then you won't be in a position where you might be able to effect meaningful change when the time comes.

Way to many leftist projects (in the sense of grassroots organisations) are just a total amateur shitshow, because of the nature of volunteering. This does not mean they don't accomplish anything, but oftentimes it takes so much time and energy to finally achieve some half-baked result.

Anticonsumption,"But you are measuring success exactly the way a neo-liberal would: how many new vegan consumers have we created?  You are right that most vegan converts these days are doing it because some (paid-by-commercials) personality on a screen has convinced them individually to do it.  It's too slow and it's too unimpactful for our movement to spread this way and have any hopes of widespread changes in industry and communities.  This is a sign of the movement's weakness and illness; as you can see, as happy as we are that veganism is growing at all, there is very little evidence that any of it has saved any animals yet. You'd be surprised how large consumer-based veganism can grow without it having any impact on animal deaths (again, read the book!).  It's why so few animals have been saved despite such growth in the vegan movement so far. Rather than measuring success by counting new vegan lifestylists, our success must be measured by how much climate change has been reversed, or how many animals were saved year over year.  That so many people in the vegan movement see success simply by making more vegan-lifestyle consumers is another sign of the weakness of the movement. We will be slightly stronger when we start to insist on real results (i.e., actually lower numbers of animals killed each year) and second, when we collectively realize that creating new vegan consumers one by one will never accomplish that, and third, when a new era of mass-scale direct action on behalf of animals and the cliamte is the norm.

Anticonsumption,"So adoption and fostering are related but distinct concepts, one. Two, I don't see the article addressing fostering. Three, actually a quick ctrl+F for 'adopt' also comes up with nothing. So I'll just try to explain myself. The thing is, most individual choices we are told will impact the environment suffer from very high tipping points and thus fail to provide meaningful results due to collective action problems. Put another way, many problems it turns out are not the sort where ""every little bit helps."" You deciding to walk to work today instead of drive will have zero measurable impact on air quality and climate change and traffic (thus zero impact on anyone else's quality of life) unless thousands of others make the same choice you do (and save for some massive policy change, the flock probably will not change behavior for obscure environmental benefits, so why should anyone individually sacrifice or inconvenience themselves for nothing?). The same can be said for choosing not to have children hoping you are ""doing your part"" for the planet or whatever, it's nothing, I agree, this is not sound logic.  Neo-liberalism has asked us to ignore this inconvenient truth and continue to express our politics through individual consumer choices, and that's why we're so familiar with the phrase ""every little bit helps"" because it is one of the most profound and important Big Lies of our neo-liberal era (takes the pressure off states to lead systemic change that threaten today's powerful elite). But then there are ""starfish"" problems where every little bit really does help.

Can't you see there are thousands of starfish on this beach and you'll never have an impact on this problem?""; person 2 to person 1, picks up a starfish, and pauses after throwing it back in the ocean to say, ""I just had an impact on that one."") The point is that whether or not birthing your own children has an impact on climate change -- I concede that this is largely a corrupt neo-liberal idea -- it certainly does have an impact on a kid in an over-crowded foster care system who needs a comfortable and safe home (and only has one childhood to live and can't wait for the revolution!).  Fostering instead of breeding is the sort of situation where ""every little bit helps."" So reducing child birthing down to simply a matter of climate change is really siloing the issues, which is another liberal tendency we ought to avoid.

Anticonsumption,"Professor James Hansen is probably your best bet to learn more in depth. Not gonna link sources on mobile, but the situation is basically this: the paris agreements said we need to get to zero emissions within a couple of decades, then have significant *negative emissions* for many years afterwards to avoid warming the planet 2C beyond the 20th century average. Exceeding 2C will be beyond disastrous, picture collapsed economies and millions of refugees dying horrible deaths. Instability everywhere. Even collapse.

Now here's the current reality: we are not moving towards zero emissions at all. In fact, the rate at which we are releasing carbon is still accelerating. The paris agreements are as good as empty words, especially without u.s support. Not to say we could just transition if we wanted to... extracting the resources needed for the panels, windmills etc, transporting them, manufacturing them, building them and then maintaining them will all require vast amounts of fossil fuels. 


Also, the idea of ""negative emissions"" is currently pure science fiction. There is no way to remove carbon from the air without burning even more energy than it took to put it there. Engineers seem to know this, policy makers not so much since they're literally banking on it for our survival. I've heard the task being described like ""removing only the sugar from a cake after you bake it"". So we better pray for a magic unlimited energy source.


BUT IT GETS BETTER. The very best climate models we have take **no** feedback loops into consideration because they are so hard to predict and quantify. You may have heard of a few of them, such as methane escaping melting permafrost in siberia (methane creates over 10x the greenhouse effect co2 does) Other feedbacks include the heat reflectivity of blue water vs. sea ice, the carbon released from exponentially more forest fires, and the arctic ice's ability to regulate the earths climate while it's  still there (not for long, a completely melted arctic is expected in the 2020s,  this will be a huge trigger for climate change).


And to top it all off, due to inertia, the carbon released today won't begin to affect us until over a decade from now. And all of the sulfates emmitted by massive ships, though extemely polluting, have actually been cooling the earth. That effect is only temporary and sulfates are being phased out due to the damage it causes.

So due to all of that, 2C is unavoidable at this point even if every human died and not another drop of oil is burned.

Anticonsumption,"Realistically? Because it isn't a silly game that takes 20 seconds and gets you a parking garage full of cheers. 

We need to change our culture. There is no way around it. To solve any one of those issues we need to change our culture. Most people need to substantially change their behaviour. The infuriating part is that it is imminently solvable, and absolutely necessary. It just requires us to roll up our sleeves. 

For example, the US could more than afford to switch to 100% clean energy generation within the next decade. Without question. The technology exists. And the wealth exists. But we would have to get closer to the OECD average tax rate to do that. I don't know if it's possible to raise taxes in the US. Amazingly the reaction to taxes being raised may be stronger than the reaction to conspiring with a foreign power to get your party in control.

We need people to stop eating meat, plastic pollution is primarily caused by fishing nets. You have to stop eating fish. Animal agriculture is perhaps THE leading cause of climate change. Responsible for 18% of global emissions it is also the leading cause of land use, ocean acidification, ocean dead zones, species loss, habitat destruction, and deforestation. Many of those, especially deforestation and ocean acidification, decrease the ability of our planet to sequester carbon. So it's impact is vastly more than the 18% of emissions alone. 

It's even easier to solve than replacing our grid. Everyone can make the decision now and carry it forward. They just won't. They refuse to. Even if they understand that it is necessary for the climate. Even if they acknowledge the unconscionable treatment of animals in the industry. They just decide that they don't care and will carry on. 

Animal based emissions are also a lovely chance to add seconds to the clock on climate change. The emissions are largely methane. If they stopped today within 25 years it would be as though they never existed. Removing 18% of our global climate impact from the atmosphere before we go over the cliff. Giving us more time to solve the other problems. But again, people just won't do it. Because they don't want to and for no other reason. 

Electric cars are becoming more popular, but the big difference will be within 30 years very few people will own cars, unless they live in remote areas. They will charter self driving fully electric cars as needed. Transport trucks are also going to be electric and probably self driving within 30 years. But, of course, we need to clean up our grid by then or it helps far less to be running a 'clean' car charged up with dirty fuel. 

Those are the 3 main drivers of climate change. Responsible for nearly 60% of emissions and far more than 60% of climate change related impact (you have to include decreased sequestration.)

And they can all be solved, so easily. So simply. It requires only minor modifications of our lifestyles and priorities. But we won't do it. We won't be the adults and decide to take the hard step, transform ourselves and then our society. Because it is hard at first, there is an adjustment. It's not a big one, but especially in America people seem to expect to never have to be the ones putting in effort, that a team of lesser minions should cater to them. 

I guess we will find out shortly if the promise of these two youngest generations, our interconnected world, our increased awareness, increased willingness to work hard, civic awareness, and flowery language about needing to take responsibility actually turns into anything. 

Funny enough millennials are the single largest block of voters in the US. There's more of us than boomers now. It's our time, right now. We can run for office. We can elect each other. We can be activists. We can demand change and lead movements. There have been efforts, I'll give you that.

Anticonsumption,"There might well be a bias, and I think that’s because the conversation has been pushed to the forefront of people’s minds in recent years.

This is just my personal opinion but I don’t think it is a bad agenda. It is not an agenda to benefit the “non meat products” industry or some evil corporation. It’s just the opinion of people that want to try and reduce the harm we inflict on our planet. I know that sounds like some hippie crap but that’s the most succinct way I can put it.

Try and compare it to a different concept that you might care about. Maybe something like global warming. These guys telling you to stop eating meat have their heart in a place where they want to make a change to the world, and want to influence others (you) to do the same, but maybe don’t have the right vocabulary to do it. It’s the same as someone saying “Stop driving cars and use your bike more to reduce the harm we are causing!” That’s an agenda too, but again, not necessarily a bad one.

The thing is, when people go militant and start calling out others and making demands like “stop eating meat!” it usually makes the other person feel attacked and double down more on their initial belief. The best we can do is talk openly about the subject without devolving into this US vs THEM fight where everyone is doubling down and nobody is even open to changing their perspective.

Murder: an emotionally tactful word to gain empathy. A poor argumentative word. 

Dairies do not kill their animals unless they are too sick or have been otherwise injured. They don’t kill the calves either, they sell those at auction. I bought a dairy calf at an auction, and he was very sweet.  Sometimes they sell their calves to the canners (slaughter house), and I agree that that sucks a lot. 

Rape: a word non-applicable to animals because... well, animals rape each other all the time! Mating is raping, if you use it in the same view that humans use the word. Have you ever seen ducks do the nasty? It’s very violent and even end up in female fatalities! 

Bulls even hurt their cows when they mate! Yes, a lot of times farmers artificially inseminate cows so they can avoid injury from an overzealous bull. They are a force to be reckoned with and I have personally seen one break a cow’s back while mounting. It was very sad :(

&gt;the planet is too overpopulated

Is it, tough? We have enoth resources too easily feed and sustain a populatuon much bigger then the current one. The main problem is that we are cough in a system that burn those resources for profit, and need exonetual growth to sustain itself. Plus, there are several ideas that contribute too resources not beeing enoth. The idea that eating meat is sensible is one of them, just to give one example.


&gt;and our growth rate hasn’t slowed down.

That depends. In industrial nations, the so called first world it not only has slowed down, but is reversing. 200 years ago about 70 % of the planet where their word country's. Today about 50 % are second world and 30 % remain first. Making the very valid assumption that the growth rate will settle itself it has in Europe and the USA, there will be a tipping point, where we reach a more or less stable population.

This hold true.

I don't know anything about the amount of oil, but I believe the reserves running down would be a good message as it would force us as a race go FINALY move on and invent into eloping  more sustainable methods of gaining  engery and enabling transportation. 


&gt;political tensions and instability are at an all time high all over the world;

I don't know about this. The cold war comes to mind, a conflict that very literally came close to wiping us and most live from the face of this planet.

Anticonsumption,"Lamb actually has the highest carbon footprint, closely followed by beef. This is mostly due to the methane they produce, which might sound ridiculous, but it's a very potent gas that contributes greatly to global warming. 
Then, and this obviously depends on the place that you live in, the land usage by far greater than that of most plants that we consume directly. Which grass fed you obviously don't need to import corn, soy, etc. from faraway lands (so that's great) but you need to make even more space for the animals as it's also their feeding ground. In addition to that, that water usage is through the roof in comparison with most plants. Of course avocados would be a terrible choice for a substitute, but most environmentally conscious vegans would not replace meat with avocados or other fruits and vegetables but with legumes like lentils or beans, which can be produced very efficiently and are much healthier and better for the environment. They're also super easy to store and don't requite refrigeration. 
As for cream, cheese, etc. - I can see why you want to eat that of course as they usually taste great, but there's nothing in terms of nutrition in it that you require. So I don't really have a substitute apart from the obvious packaged vegan cheeses but I don't consume those. For milk I think oatmilk is the best alternative from an environmental standpoint. 

Here's a pretty comprehensive article: https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/meat-eaters-guide-get-to-know-the-carbon-footprint-of-your-diet-lamb-beef-cheese-are-the-worst.html 

There are also plenty of studies out there if you're interested in that. 

In addition to all of these problems, there's obviously also an ethical component, and no, grass fed doesn't mean ethical. And while buying local, organic, grass fed animal products is definitely better than buying imported factory farmed goods, it's still not ideal and you'd probably even save some money by incorporating more legumes, grains and other staple foods into your diet.

Anticonsumption,"Yes and No.

No, because this phenomenon occurs because natural bodies of stationary water almost always freeze from the top down, Flash flooding in marshland and mangrove fields can stagnant long enough to freeze on the top, the permeability of the soil can be unrelated to the atmospheric and wind temperatures, likewise, drainage further down in the water line can occur independently to the freezing temperatures allowing water that is not yet frozen to drain away while the ice must wait for temperatures to increase before it can also drain.

So this kind of thing occurring in general isn't related to climate change.

What *is* related to climate change is the history of this event happening in this location. 

Does this happen once a year basically every year for the last several hundred years? Then it's not climate change, it's just how the weather is in this area.

Is this a freak or random thing to happen in this location? or has this been happening regularly but only in the last few years or decades? then it's probably related to climate change.

But I admit I find myself thinking, that’s handmade, it’s understandable, it’s worth it. That has made me think that part of the problem with fast fashion is that we’re so far removed from the people who make these clothes. Yes, they come from factories, but there is still the element of “handmade”; there are real people working in these factories. I knit/crochet myself and know other people who do a range of crafts, we all know how much time it takes to make something from scratch and materials aren’t always cheap either.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Livestock is the world’s largest user of land resources, with pasture and arable land dedicated to the production of feed representing almost 80% of the total agricultural land. One-third of global arable land is used to grow feed, while 26% of the Earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface is used for grazing.

Seems like you would have way less soil that needs to be regenerated if you dramatically reduced the amount of agriculture happening around the world, which would be the result of switching away from animal agriculture.

https://www.globalagriculture.org/fileadmin/files/weltagrarbericht/Weltagrarbericht/04Fleisch/WaitroseReport.pdf

The crop calorie input to meat calorie output on animals is highly inefficient, up to 10:1, meaning we could feed 10 times as many people on the same land use for feed crops, or the same number of people on 1/10th the land used.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level

So, again, switching to vegan diets would result in much less land being used, and that would of course bring with it numerous subsequent benefits of like halting the destruction of forests all over the world.

Finally, animal industry is responsible for between 18-51% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, more than any other industry. This is driving the primary existential threat to our species, climate change, and arguably the most critical aspect of the issue after the ethical question related to enslaving and slaughtering billions of our fellow sentient beings every year.

Anticonsumption,"We produce way more plants than we need to to feed livestock, so even if we care about bugs, that's a reason to go vegan. 

We also need plants to live. We can live without meat and dairy. We also can and should reform farming practices. But raising plants isn't inherently harmful or immoral the way killing meat is. 

Where did you get this statistic about grass-fed beef? I'm not going to give money to have an animal killed for me regardless. But also if you could give some sources as to how much plant ag actually harms animals that would be helpful. 

There are actually apps that will tell you how many animal lives are saved. And from an environmental standpoint, which you claim to care about, climate change will kill many more animals than fertilizer. 

I'm not sure what black and white stance I'm taking? Killing and harming animals is wrong and we should do our best to mitigate it. That's only as black and white as ""killing and harming humans is wrong and we should do our best to try to mitigate it."" If you want to argue that vegans could do more than just change their diets I'm more than open to that. 

Cars and bikes aren't inherently immoral the way killing and harming animals needlessly is. But like I said, if you want to critique vegans for not going as far as they should, I'm on board. But I think it's hard to defend others doing less. The fact that you make these arguments about plant ag hurting animals only strengthens the idea that yes those things are immoral.

Anticonsumption,"Grass fed animals cannot be produced in a way that is sustainable and environmentally innocuous. To meet the current demand for meat, we'd have way too many cows taking up way too much land and they would stilll produce a ton of methane. 

Like I said, I'm more than on board for reforming plant ag. 

You realize meat goes bad, right? You can freeze it for a while but not for years. 

You haven't actually proved the loss of life is the same though. You haven't provided any statistics on how many or which animals plant ag kills. Not to mention that you still aren't factoring in all the plant ag produced to feed livestock. 

Not to mention that even if you were correct about the amount of animals killed, that doesn't make meat eating ok, it just means we really need to work on reforming plant ag, and as I said, I'm more than on board. Again, we can't live without plants

We shouldn't buy things that contribute to animal suffering insofar as is reasonable and doable for us. For the vast majority of people in the western world, you can pretty reasonably cut out meat and dairy, not buy leather, etc. Not seeing why you have an issue with that. 

I personally will eat local honey. From the research I've done, the necessity to keep the honey bee alive outweighs other concerns. Some vegans may not call me vegan for that reason. I don't care. 

By inherently immoral, I mean the act, in and of itself, is immoral. If an act, outside of context, is immoral, then it is inherently immoral. Driving a car would not unnecessarily kill something in all context. In our context, driving a car has a small impact on climate change which does kill things. It's something we should avoid, but it isn't inherently immoral.

Anticonsumption,"Obviously you wouldn't go buy a whole cow's worth of meat at once, I'm saying over the course of that time, that would be your share of it.

As far as I know, statistics aren't available for number of animals killed for plant ag, but if we're counting bugs, it's a lot. 

Again, plants are not grown to feed grass fed animals, they eat the grass. Grass fed meat can be sustainable, just at much, much lower levels than Americans eat meat currently. That doesn't mean that it's the best option, but there is a sustainable level.

Driving your car doesn't just contribute to climate change, you also directly hit and kill bugs and other animals every time you drive it. So if you choose to drive when it isn't necessary, you are intentionally and unnecessarily killing something. Is a bug or mouse life worth less than a cow's?

On top of that, this enormous amount of water comes from already drought-ridden California.

Anticonsumption,"*""I believe an animal deserves a decent life, but a prey animal is a prey animal. It's either me or another predator that's going to eat it.""*

Yes, and that's nature. But our modern agricultural practices resemble nothing like nature. Cows are artificially bred by manually extracting semen from a bull and by having a person stuck their whole arm up their anus to inject it. 

Chickens get their beaks cut off because the space they're in is so small they start pecking their own body. 

Pigs get castrated and have their teeth cut off without any pain killers because they get so nervous being in such awful environments that they hurt one another. 

*""You're typing this response on a computer, probably created by slave labor in china. Powered by fossil fuels, or perhaps renewable which of course still have a human cost. Where do your clothes come from, who made them? How many people died at the hand of your government so you could have cheap, easy access to this stuff? How many kids, babies, women?""*

And what's that got to do with veganism? The fact that bad things happen in this world doesn't mean you should dismiss veganism. Just because there's a war going on in Syria, or people are getting paid pennies for a day's work in Central America does not mean that you can dismiss veganism by saying ""There are bigger problems to face""

*""The way we make things better is harm reduction. You're wasting your breath by trying to convert people to veganism. Baby steps, push meatless days, push sourcing your meat, tell people to kill it themselves. I'm converted to environmentalism, and I'm converted to suffering through more than one meatless day a week. Making dishes where meat is no longer the main focus. Paying a shitload of moeny for the meat that I do eat to make sure it's as cruelty free as possible and sustainable.""* 

Just because you're not ready to ditch out animal products doesn't mean other people are. You think I was born vegan? I ate meat, cheese and eggs evey single day until I quit coldturkey. Animals are suffering every single day. They are getting murdered in the most horrible way, every single day, billions of them. 

Also, our planet is dying. I dunno if you know that animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change? That thing that is threatening our very existence on this planet, have you heard of that? Meatless mondays are not gonna do shit. 

I assume you're not a 15 year old kid. I assume you're an adult who thinks rationally and cares about his/her own role in this planet. That's why you're here, right? Or do you just wanna argue with vegans?

*""Paying a shitload of moeny for the meat that I do eat to make sure it's as cruelty free as possible and sustainable.""*

That means nothing to the animal that is brutally killed. And grass-fed, free range is even worse for the environment.

*""Work on what we can actually change, not your utopian society. I'd love to have medicare for all, ubi, legalized drugs and open borders. But those things are going to take awhile.

Anticonsumption,"No, I disagree. I think there is a difference in value between a life that exists and a prospective life that might exist in the future. 

I do not think we should kill someone who is alive now, as their life has worth and they exist. 

But to refrain from dragging a new soul into existence — I think that is a good thing. Firstly, because your future child has not consented to being born. What happens if your child is raped? 1 in 6 women are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. This means that by having a child, you are giving them a 1 in 12 chance that they will be sexually assaulted. I don’t think that is a fair game of chance to force on someone against their will.

And yes, good things can happen. But I do not think it is fair of me to say to you: I am going to force you to play a game. 20% chance I give you $100, 12% chance I rape you. By having children you are forcing a new life to play this game, and you are forcing the child to take all the risks.

Right now you have two (?) kids. You have forced them into playing a game that they might not have wanted to play. With two kids, the probability that at least one of them will be sexually assaulted is 1-0.88*0.88=23%. They are taking that risk, not you. They are the ones who will have to deal with coming climate change, not you. They will probably have to bury their own parents. And then they will die themselves. All for what? 🤷‍♀️ 

If you didn’t have any children, you could just live the next 60 years having some fun and not worrying about how shitty the world is going to become. Yes, your children wouldn’t exist, but right now your 3rd, 4th, and 5th children don’t exist either, and you aren’t complaining about them not existing. Neither are they complaining about not existing, because they don’t exist! Instead you are spending time, money, and energy on your children, who will have untold suffering brought upon them in the upcoming years. It seems like a lose-lose situation to me.

&gt;any amount which is growing (in our case exponentially) is inevitablly going to surpass any finite amount.

You're argument as I follow it is that capitalism can't work because it relies on growth.^1 Growth can't go on forever because there is some upper limit on the human race which you haven't clearly defined yet (population, natural resources, acres of land, food, etc). Therefore, capitalism is doomed to fail. Have I got that right? However, a couple of your comments have seemed to conflict with that. Regardless, I'm saying that our current rate of growth doesn't have to always be the current growth rate. We can taper it. Our population can plateau or shrink, our *new slowly growing* demand of natural resources can fall short of the *growing or infinite supply of natural resources*, and we can still experience economic growth and improvements in quality of life with capitalism, as we do things in an evermore intelligent, clean, and sustainable manner.

1) Not really true either, ponzi schemes require growth, not capitalism. Many countries are capitalistic and have stagnant or falling populations and using less resources, or have falling GDP.

Anticonsumption,"That’s my opinion yes. Just enough capitalism to keep people from getting lazy, just enough to keep the things that bring out the best in humanity from healthy competition, and a nice safety net and set of government provided services so the baseline is still reasonably comfortable, allows for retraining, life changes and lifelong learning.

I think with stuff like that there you have healthy innovation in places where it’s needed, not always wanted. There’s room to be rewarded for doing what’s right, not just what pays good.

Im no expert, I’d love to go back to school to study this further, but between the study of psychology, economics, relationships, etc. I think it’s far too much to sit on one person to design a system that works like that, that’s capable of adapting fluidly. 

I think people need to keep talking about these things like they can do something about it - move away from the learned helplessness and use whatever time they have to participate in government by voting, holding leaders accountable, and perhaps if they’ve the mind for it,  trying to be a leader for a while. 

It’s hard being the leader in that sense, if you’re in it for the right reasons it is truly exhausting, and full of worry and concern, and takes a strong ethic and strong will to push through. The best ones often leave too soon.

I don’t think Americans can ever go full socialist. It’s a completely different culture that’s reliant on looking out for your brothers and sisters first and yourself second. You go to work everyday to work for each other, they’re motivated by different things. The ones that wish for more, for bigger houses, nicer cars, whom have less social attachment to family and friends, they often leave socialist countries and come to North America.

I don’t think people realize when they ask for full socialism what that means as a country and what they have to give up.

It’s a massive trade off. All those fancy buildings and infrastructure, nice cars. Powerful phones, they were all built upon the labour of those who make and have less than you, so that you may have more.

The people that have lots are not going to sit idle and let that get taken away. The power that comes with being able to purchase businesses, people, things, and ideas is something that gets leveled out when you start taxing hard and turning that income that people make into public services.

For example; Some people don’t believe libraries should be payed for with taxes - they don’t read book from there. They go buy books when they want one...

I had an argument with a guy at work once about public libraries. He believed you should pay admission. 

He needed to see what more than just books places like that provided and how by keeping people safe there as well it also kept him safe. Things like that also reduce crime, in addition to teaching, borrowing and building relationships.

So what I’m saying is that people need to wrap their head around this a little more and know what they’re asking for, and then go ask for it, or make it happen. It’s the only way to make change. 

A conservative capitalism will sooner agree to a library here, or a safe house there, or other social services one at a time sooner than they will agree to universal basic income right off the block.

Neither the study nor the article refute my point.  Both focus on minimizing the effect of A CURRENTLY LIVING PERSON on the environment, not the carbon cost of adding new people (something that isn't explored in the article or the study).

A quote from the study:
""With current diets and production practices, feeding 7.6 billion people is degrading terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, depleting water resources, and driving climate change."" (which means that in scope, they didn't look at the environmental cost of people just of what the current population ate, and the cost of the food supply chain).

Anticonsumption,"I see what you're saying and totally agree about the bottled water point (I live in an area that's basically being plundered by Nestle). However, I worry you misunderstand what is meant by water consumption! This is not a case of water vanishing, but rather of the structural and energy costs associated with high water demand.

Fresh water is an incredibly valuable resource, and one that is easily rendered unsuitable by pollution and use. Lakes are often geographically inaccessible or just inconvenient for mass transport of what is a pretty heavy substance, rivers are used frequently in industry as an easy source of water and waste disposal (hence spoiling them and the basin they run through), and most importantly, saltwater desalination is *enormously* energy-intensive, which passes the buck along to global climate change. Even if all of the water from these processes rained back down, we're recovering only a tiny, tiny fraction of it, and this is entirely setting aside the other issues of eutrophication, run-off, and CH4/CO2 production.

Nobody is saying that water disappears. What it *is* saying is that it contributes to the complex and multifaceted issue of water scarcity, which is actually an increasingly pressing in this century as rain deposition patterns change and desertification spreads. You're clearly keyed in to other issues related to water scarcity, but the thing is, this is related too! :)

When I look at those parents and their attitudes, I can see that a lot of things go into it - culture, politics, and childhood experiences to start. Like, my family lived on an island (you are stuck there with your trash, so it's obvious that you better try to make less) with strong indigenous cultural influences (so caring about the environment was normalized). I think my friend's parent's negativity about conservation might be partly a reaction to liberalism and partly a repudiation of an underprivileged childhood, like ""see, I can buy whatever I want now"". 

Sorry you're frustrated with your parents! I think that's totally understandable. For me, sometimes it's tough to sit with the feeling that the older generations are blissfully effing things up and leaving the younger generations with shit, and that there's not much you can do about it.

Bread, rice, potatoes, bananas, broccoli, beans, oranges, spaghetti, tomato sauce, etc. are all cheaper than meat where I live. This is true in most places in the world, with the exception of remote areas like Alaska. 

I'm not knocking you: clearly you are putting in an effort, which is more than most people can say. But so many people seem to be in denial about supply and demand, and imagine that if the government just passed the right legislation regulating large companies, all our problems would be solved. Individual choices *do* matter, and one form of collective action is a boycott, which is nothing more than a bunch of individuals making the choice not to buy products from a company that is behaving badly. Boycotts have proven successful, e.g. the Delano Grape Strike, perhaps even more successful than trying to get things done using the political system, but they require people to actually vote with their wallet and not just wait around until someone you like gets elected.

These ideas floating around that making lifestyle changes is impossible or radical or just impractical for an everyday citizen are mostly excuses to not actually put your money where your mouth is. The fact of the matter is that even if the government does actually step up and start some serious efforts to combat climate change, one of the main ways they will accomplish this is through taxation or cap-and-trade, and the impact of this on people will be that *everything* that causes carbon emissions will be more expensive. Electricity powered by coal will be more expensive, meat will be more expensive, plane trips will be more expensive, gasoline will be more expensive, as they should be. So the way I like to think if it now is that by buying meat, or gasoline, or coal-powered electricity, you are basically taking a subsidy. Your lifestyle is being subsidized by future generations, who will have to bear the costs. But moreover, the meat and dairy and fossil fuel industries actually are *directly* subsidized by the government (not just not taxed enough to account for their negative externalities). Meat and dairy and gasoline would be way more expensive (and they are in other parts of the world) without these subsidies. 

If you are barely scraping by, and need a car to get to work, or are in a situation where you literally can't buy potatoes and other affordable food (like living in a food desert), then by all means take those subsidies. But this idea that the average American simply doesn't have the means to stop eating meat is complete nonsense.

Anticonsumption,"**Climate change**

Climate change occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in new weather patterns that last for at least a few decades, and maybe for millions of years. The climate system is comprised of five interacting parts, the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water), cryosphere (ice and permafrost), biosphere (living things), and lithosphere (earth's crust and upper mantle). The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun, with a relatively tiny amount from earth's interior. The climate system also gives off energy to outer space.

You know this is not feasible for most people at all, and those are much more complicated issues than you make them out to be. I don't only care about human suffering, and the 100 billion animals who are slaughtered every year in our animal agriculture system are a far larger amount and endure absolutely horrifyingly conditions. You want to ignore it, and I did too. 

&gt;they are specifically grown for food so humanity doesn't die from starvation

I could specifically grow you for food if I wanted (I could not really because that's illegal because it's not socially acceptable). We do not need to eat meat at all. It is horrible for the planet and incredibly inefficient. Cattle ranching is the biggest reason why the Amazon rainforest is being destroyed, domesticated animals release a ton of methane (an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change), domesticated animals use all the space and resources of themselves and the massive amounts of food they eat (far more than directly from plants to humans), and domesticated animals also act as a source for a number of other problems like farmers pumping them full of antibiotics and creating superbugs.

&gt;I want to end human suffering by ending world hunger, poverty, and war.

Great way to end world hunger: instead of feeding far larger than the amount of food a human would eat to domesticated animals, how about we feed humans? We already have the resources; we are distributing them in a way that is completely inefficient.

&gt;Animals are a resource like trees, coal, or oxygen, that's it.

You legitimately sound like a sociopath, and I am asking: are you? This is a real question and not something to be ashamed for. I'm curious. But, *you* as we outlined could also be a resource. I could do all the things that are done to other domesticated animals to you, and you could be a product. People could eat your meat, and I could sell it for a lot. The thing you are disregarding intentionally again is the suffering of other creatures. 

&gt;They're just one element in a long chain of biological resources that go up and down the food chain.

You clearly don't care about the huge body of scientific evidence and common knowledge that domesticated animals, like any conscious creatures, absolutely feel pain and suffer. You don't want to address the truth or change or challenge your beliefs. So, I suppose I will just leave this here. We are getting nowhere. It's important to have arguments like this in any case, but I urge you to challenge your beliefs.

Anticonsumption,"Oh there’s loads of variables involved, that’s why I said it, as if you look at a huge amount of those variables they often lead back to the global economy. A few examples:

- many countries which have suffered famines have at the same time been net exporters of food (Ireland during the potato famine for example). 
- Africa has the most diverse range of cereal/grain crops in the world but the countries buying grains don’t want diversity, and favour monoculture farming. Monoculture are more susceptible to disease and at risk of climate change etc, whereas farming a variety of crops together mean that even if disease strikes one type, some will survive and the farmer can still eat/ get paid. 
- Africa’s diverse range of grain crops include many highly specialised to the soil types there and to the climatic conditions, but the countries that buy their crops only want a small range of non-local crops grown, and will not buy the local species. These foreign crops require fertiliser, pesticides, irrigation etc which all cost the farmer money and cut profits, and mean farmers are far more at risk if a crop fails. 
- climate change is caused in part by our wealthy and resource heavy lifestyles (and our economy) which is causing many of the problems worldwide that lead to famines. 
- a huge amount of soy (a protein source) is fed to cows and other farmer animals worldwide who “produce” far less food energy per kg than the initial soy had (a net loss of energy). It’s economically more sense for farmers than feeding them grass.
- an increasing amount of potential food is being directly made into biofuels and biochar (which should ideally be made from waste products).


Those are just a few examples, and all eventually lead back to the economy, hence what I said. I’m not saying that all the food we currently produce is good or sustainable, it is definitely not. Also not saying that traditional practices would be able to feed the worlds population today. Just saying that, environmental issues aside, if food and wealth was distributed more evenly, there wouldn’t be famines.

&gt;Africa has the most diverse range of cereal/grain crops in the world but the countries buying grains don’t want diversity, and favour monoculture farming.

These foreign crops require fertiliser, pesticides, irrigation etc which all cost the farmer money and cut profits, and mean farmers are far more at risk if a crop fails.

Well if Africans started to sell their grain more localized they could probably not worry about what other non-African countries want as much but this again leads to a plethora of political variables. A government of poor individuals in a small African company will take bribes from a big company/government to produce whatever crop those people want if it benefits themselves. That is the problem with corrupt governments. 

&gt;climate change is caused in part by our wealthy and resource heavy lifestyles (and our economy) which is causing many of the problems worldwide that lead to famines.

While I won't argue that climate change is a problem, famines and droughts have existed (and will continue to exist) since prehistoric times. [America went through a terrible drought and famine during the Great Depression.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl) Climate change =/= global warming, which I think would more accurately describe the problem you are trying to explain.

Anticonsumption,"Your buffalo link actually states that they wanted more space for their own ranches and less competition, and that they wanted the natives confined to reserves. Those factors are ultimately about money. 

Not even going to get into what you’ve said about Africa but in any case a lot of the issues in some countries there are remnants of the colonial era where a small amount of countries carved up the continent between themselves and used it to harvest all the resources for themselves and build wee trapped economies for them to unevenly trade with. 

These countries aren’t still colonised but are often still stuck with those ex colonisers as their main trading partners and often as land owners in many areas too. It takes a long time to actually recover from colonialism. 

In any case, if it was simply “corrupt governments” as you say, that does go back to money and power which is the economy. 

The Great Depression was a financial crisis and from what I’ve read about it, farmers were booted off their land in America when they couldn’t pay rent and little to no government aid was provided for these and other people who were laid off during it. American tried to encourage people to buy locally and imposed tariffs on imports, so other countries retaliated by imposing tariffs on American products which hit America hard. 

In addition to this, America had the Dust Bowl which was caused by a few factors, one being that they employed farming methods and used crops which were not specialised for the ecology of the area they were in, and displaced native plant species which were adapted to it and which prevented erosion. The Dust Bowl displaced a huge amount of people and resulted in a huge loss of crops. Not exactly a “natural” problem and certainly not helped by the financial crash which prevented America from importing and exporting to support its economy and to feed its people. 

I know many biofuels are made of waste, I’m just saying many aren’t and use a lot of land. The world isn’t black and white, there’s never a “this happens in every case” example. 

Politics are often driven by economics. 

Migration to urban areas actually has many environmental benefits interestingly by the way (in richer countries anyway). Obviously there are environmental issues too, I just find this interesting. 

Again, I’m not saying economics is the only reason for issues, more that it exasperates them and takes a local food shortage (often of only one type of local crop) and makes it a much bigger issue. 

Also you mentioned earlier that droughts happened throughout history, yes, but humans are historically a migratory species, both seasonally and longer term in response to climate changes. It’s how we’ve colonised the Earth. Our creation of borders has made that a lot more difficult for many and as many countries want to keep their wealth for their own people, it’s a lot more difficult now to migrate and start afresh somewhere new in response to famine. 

As for overpopulation, I would recommend looking into the reasons for overpopulation and also separately the per person environmental impact difference between richer and poorer countries. 

I’m not saying the economy is all bad, I’ve certainly benefited from it as I’m not 100% self sufficient and even if I was, all my learning has been thanks to the economy. All I’m saying is that it’s worth noting the strong link between the economy and devastating famines.

I'm sorry to hear your school failed to teach you this fundamental aspect of Catholicism. The schools I attended did, but most of my education was before climate change had become politicized. The human tendency to change our beliefs to fit in with a group we identify with is present in Catholics. Some that have sided with the right wing over abortion have started rejecting Catholic teachings that don't fit with their ideology. This isn't limited to caring for creation, it extends to rejecting basic human rights such as healthcare, housing, education, adequate employment, worker strikes, family support &amp; emigration. I have personally witnessed Catholics doubting the legitimacy of Pope Francis to the point of questioning if he's the antichrist, which has been an anti-Catholic idea since the reformation. There are those of us who view this to be part of the beginnings of a schism.
  
This maybe-schism has driven a lot of ppl from the Church. My school was in line with Rome, but my family wasn't. Growing up, the faith I was taught was a hateful weapon. It made me feel like God didn't love me. This drove me away from the Church for 15 years. I didn't even consider the possibility of returning to the Church until I started dating my husband.

Sounds great. I'm a capitalist, and I certainly don't see people only as consumers.

As to your follow-on example, the obvious flaw is a flaw of scale. You're pretending that the obscenely rich make up 10 percent of the population, which is obviously not even remotely accurate. And waiting for the obscenely rich to give up their riches is...well, let me put it this way; good luck with that. Fortunately, you don't have to.

&gt;A LOT of people are achieving sustainable lifestyles without robbing from the rich.

I am sorry but you are totally in denial if you think this will be enough at all even if all of us who are able to switched to a 'more sustainable lifestyle'.

&gt;You've got it the wrong way around. Our rights lead to capitalism. No economic system provides rights; however, some (like socialism) demand that some rights be destroyed.

Capitalism since the very beginning has relied on some people having different privileges than others.  These are not rights.  The 'right' that Communism would take away is the right to exploit people, this is DEFINITELY not a right.

&gt;Capitalism can't solve climate change. No economic system can, for the same reason that no wrench can measure a voltage; that's not the function of it. Economic systems do one thing; distribute scarce resources. That's it. You might as well ask a philosophical system to cook you dinner.

Despite us knowing about this for 50 years and despite now knowing that we have 12 years before we cannot stop the extinction level event we have already started C02 emissions have gone up, new gas and coal plants are still being built and not one major Government has launched an initiative appropriate to the scale of the issue.

&gt; Socialism by any other name would smell as foul. It's still a system that has slain millions

Okay, firstly you are in a Socialist country... whether it is actively identifying as one or trying to push closer to Communism is another matter.  Secondly while I am saddened at the number of deaths in 'Communism' I am sick of people mentioning it whilst ignoring the deaths that occur in Capitalism. The difference seems to be that the 'right' people die in Capitalism and therefore this can be written off as a natural thing.

&gt;it's still doomed to failure

Capitalism is doomed to failure, the powers that be have to fix it every 20 years or so to ensure that they stay that way.  Eventually we will realise it for the scam it is (the biggest contradiction, that most rich people are simply born rich, even a child can notice). But in the short term, individual consumer choices cannot save us.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;You are not a good capitalist then. Take that as a compliment as it is meant as such.

I take it neither as a compliment nor an insult, mostly because it isn't true. I believe that people should have the right to own their property and labor and to exchange it with others as they see fit. That's all it means to be a capitalist.

&gt;Its not totally right but its not too far off. If I am using 2015 figures Steve (representing 10% of the population) would own 28 apples, Bill and Susan (the next 20%) would have 1.5 apples and the rest (bottom 70%) would share 2.5 apples

Okay. Now let's compare the 2.5 apples that the bottom 70 percent shares with the average amount of apple each person gets under communism.

&gt;I am sorry but you are totally in denial if you think this will be enough at all even if all of us who are able to switched to a 'more sustainable lifestyle'.

If you like. It's certainly more effective than waiting around for capitalism to fall and, in the meantime, not changing at all because you think that individual choices don't matter.

&gt;Capitalism since the very beginning has relied on some people having different privileges than others. 

How so, exactly? I'm not asking how capitalism has allowed for that; I'm asking how it RELIES on that.

&gt;These are not rights. The 'right' that Communism would take away is the right to exploit people, this is DEFINITELY not a right.

The rights that communism would take away is the right to own your own property and labor and to exchange what you own with others freely as you see fit.

&gt;Again, it just sounds like you are in total denial over what is needed here. Despite us knowing about this for 50 years and despite now knowing that we have 12 years before we cannot stop the extinction level event we have already started C02 emissions have gone up, new gas and coal plants are still being built and not one major Government has launched an initiative appropriate to the scale of the issue.

How does the scale of the issue mean that I'm ""in total denial"" just because I understand that a system for distributing scarce resources is not the appropriate primary approach to combating climate change?

&gt;Okay, firstly you are in a Socialist country

Eh, kind of, but not really. We have some socialist programs, sure, but capitalism is by FAR the dominant economic system. The same is true of China and Russia, for what it's worth.

&gt;Secondly while I am saddened at the number of deaths in 'Communism' I am sick of people mentioning it whilst ignoring the deaths that occur in Capitalism. The difference seems to be that the 'right' people die in Capitalism and therefore this can be written off as a natural thing.

How many mass starvation events have occurred because of Capitalism? Not UNDER capitalism, mind; BECAUSE of it. How many political prisoners have been sent to the gulag or its equivalent under capitalism?

&gt;Capitalism is doomed to failure, the powers that be have to fix it every 20 years or so to ensure that they stay that way. Eventually we will realise it for the scam it is (the biggest contradiction, that most rich people are simply born rich, even a child can notice). But in the short term, individual consumer choices cannot save us.

So we'll just keep on using 100 gallons of fresh water per person per day until....when?

&gt;I don't care whether people call the solution another brand of capitalism that doesn't prioritise short term profit but we need to be doing a lot of things we are not doing right now because our system (again, happy to pretend it is not an inherit issue with capitalism) is simply not able to organise it.

Under capitalism, the corporation that spends money retooling its production facilities to create a new, more ecofriendly product has invested large financial risk. It needs an almost guaranteed reward to do so, which is why government subsidies are the only reason we've gotten what little climate change progress we have so far. 

If the return on investment doesn't come, it actively dissuades competitors from following their example, and the forward thinking corporation loses market share or even folds. Thus market share of less altruistic corporations increases over time, as they don't take risks and keep exploiting the market in the same old way.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;When the problems are structural, the solutions won't be individual. The issue with your logic is that it assumes people even have a choice.

We do. Those choices may be hard, and they may not lead to the most desirable personal results, but here's the thing; that won't magically change if the government forces people to make those choices instead of those choices being made voluntarily. Imagine, if you will, that there is an ideal course of action for society, a perfect thing for every person to be doing. Does that thing change if they do it voluntarily or if they do it because the police make them do it at gunpoint? Of course not. And if they do it voluntarily, we save all the trouble of telling that cop to point the gun.

&gt;Here is a good critique of the individual responsibility argument.

I'm sorry I read that to the end, because it makes the same tired mistake that nearly all such ""critiques"" make. It looks at the idea that people should take individual responsibility and laments that it will never be enough, instead demanding mass action and complaining about the economic system. OBVIOUSLY mass action is necessary. No one is saying that one person, or three people, or a dozen people can control climate change (or, really, most other problems) by spending in a principled fashion. OBVIOUSLY serious change requires the action of many people. But acting as principled consumers is the only way to true, lasting change. Trying to legislate people into principled actions never, ever works in the long run. And with every attempt, the government gets bigger, and more expensive, and harder to manage. And the beautiful thing about capitalism is that it allows for people to functionally implement whatever economic system they choose. Want to live as a socialist? Okay. Want to be a communist? Fine.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Coined by US geoscientist Peter Haff in 2014, the **technosphere** is the system that consists of individual humans, human societies – and stuff. In terms of stuff, humans have produced an extraordinary 30 trillion metric tons of things. From skyscrapers to CDs, fountains to fondue sets. A good deal of this is infrastructure, such as roads and railways, which links humanity together.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It seems sensible to assume that the reason products and services are made is so that they can be bought and sold and so the makers can turn a profit. So the drive for innovation – for faster, smaller phones, for example – is driven by being able to make more money by selling more phones. In line with this, the environmental writer George Monbiot argued that the root cause of climate change and other environmental calamities is capitalism and consequently any attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately fail if we allow capitalism to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This goes beyond the question of “what difference could I make?” to “what difference can anyone make?” While flying less, cutting down on eating meat and dairy and cycling to work are all commendable steps to take, they do not constitute living outside the technosphere.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s not just that we give tacit consent to the technosphere by using its roads, computers, or intensively farmed food. It’s that by being a productive member of society, by earning and spending, above all by consuming, we further the technosphere’s growth.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a good article. One criticism, in his conclusion he states that the current economic attitude places no value on essential components of our planet like trees, frogs, the ocean unless they produce something for us or as a dumping ground, and that we need to start seeing them as components of an Earth system that we aren't in control of.

&gt;Ralf Dahm:

&gt;""It is perfectly clear that all reasonable researchers who know about this experiment condemn it completely, and it was irresponsible to make such an experiment with current knowledge, and we should simply not intervene in the germline with the current level of knowledge."" 

Ralf Dahm is a Fucking Moron. This experiment should be celebrated as the first sucesful human genome modification that not only immunizes the person from one of the worst diseases out there but also seems to have a side effect of making the girl smarter (shows high intelligence in tests).

&gt;The most obvious example is for her:

&gt;""Atomic technology."" The question of disposal was never clarified, but it was propagated as a clean technique, which is incomprehensible to me, and I think that makes it clear that it's all about framing and the snippet you look at. "" 

Its incomprehensible to you because you are uneducated. Nuclear energy is clean and disposal is much cheaper than any other form of energy we have (including renewables). It is also safer (there are more people who died from solar panel instalation accidents in a single year than from nuclear power use in its entire history). Of course things like Obama closing down the best disposal site in US and telling the plants to keep the waste locally doesnt help. This is the worst decision Obama has ever done in his entire career. And yes, this is worse than drone strikes.

This article is great proof of why morality has no place in science - it ruins it.

&gt;the biologist Ralf Dahm of the University of Mainz:

&gt;""Atomic bombs - you do not have to argue with anyone - are something that no reasonable person wants to be able to do, on the other hand, nuclear technology has also brought a lot of good.""

Atomic bombs is the reason you did not have cold war turn into WW3, you idiot.

&gt;""So the question is not so very: is a technique inherently good or evil? it is usually neither nor yet. The question is always: in what context is it used? ""

Oh, so you actually know the answer, you just ignore it because you need to do moral grandstanding. I correct myself, you are not a moron, you are maliciuos.

&gt;also about making changes to animals, plants or other organisms that some people do not want It is also legitimate that people do not want that.

No, it is not legitimate that people do not want that. People who do not want that are horrible because they want people to suffer horrible diseases when we have a way to fix that. They are the kind of people that would go to hell would hell exist.

&gt;This is why it is a problem. Slow transport did not upset the climate.

The climate does not care. It just does what physics affects it to do. The problem with climate change is always - will it threaten human way of life, because otherwise climate change is irrelevant. Slow transport would actually produce worse effects if it needed to transport same amount of cargo. Well maybe except cargo ships, which do produce less pollution per weight transfered.

Anticonsumption,"(Without some hard statistics, it's really difficult to go too deep in this discussion, but I'll try.)  
First of all,  
&gt; in 1800, over 85% of people on earth lived in extreme poverty  
  
Getting people out of extreme poverty being an improvement is controversial because it is based on the assumption that a currency-based economy is an absolute necessity. This is not proven beyond reasonable doubt.  
  
Moving on,  
  
1. You seem to be singularly focused on climate change(^EDIT: climate change and power generation). Bear in mind that a stable energy source is only one of the requisite input. Sure, renewable sources of energy have recently gone competitive. But technological advances do not reach every nook and crannies of the Earth all at the same time. (^EDIT: Remember when [""ExxonMobil funded a disinformation campaigned aimed at discrediting scientists and blocking government efforts to fight climate change for more than 50 years""](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/oil-company-records-exxon-co2-emission-reduction-patents)? We even had(have?) to contend with large corporation(s) *working actively against it*, for pete's sake.\) What about other factors of production? You still need raw materials, labor, land, to name a few, to maintain the current economy.  
  
2. One major critique of the consumption lifestyle is the encouragement of an self-indulgent lifestyle. Advertisements and other forces of popular culture have drummed up a fairly strong public desire for the ""latest and greatest"". Meanwhile, businesses are trying to achieve economies of scale. As such, this leads to a gradual lifestyle creep, in which it takes more and more resources to sustain a person. Coupled with the explosive growth of Earth's population, this undeniably means an increase in both resources consumed per capita AND the total amount consumed worldwide.   
  
3. The problem is that, by subversively driving up demand to meet the burgeoning supply, we are seeing very unfortunate consequences that extend beyond climate change. Commercial interests have uprooted and displaced entire communities, human or otherwise, to enable unfettered mining of natural resources. Minorities who refuse to assimilate into their respective majority cultures(learn their language, adopt religion etc.) are being mistreated. These are just two of the things that have fallen through the cracks and not captured by the rosy-looking percentages. Above all, we all know about the atrocities committed in WWI and II and what the textbooks say caused them. Well, part of cause was definitely a competition for land, natural resources, and cheap labor. Every day, different groups with conflicting interests are pitted against each other. As long as we continue to promote infinite consumption and economic growth, the shortage of rare Earth, clean water, and land will never cease. The only question is when it will reach the boiling point (again) and conflict will erupt, again.  
  
4. Let's not forget the (^EDIT: other forms of) pain and suffering humanity has inflicted upon themselves in the name of growth. Labor exploitation (sweatshop conditions, wage mishandling, child labor etc.), human trafficking/unregulated migration, and pollution (at least, insofar as it degrades to living conditions.) are just a few at the top of my head. *But what about the numbers? Surely there is no doubt that on average, humans are doing better than before!* The icing on the cake is that, the parameters you cited (*life expectancy, education (including women), ... and many more*) rely heavily on state-reported numbers. Especially in politically oppressive countries - with governing bodies that show a pattern of disrespect towards its citizens, censorship, an inclination for cover-ups - one has to take the official statistics with an enormous grain of salt. Power struggles, corruption, the entanglement of the rich and powerful all serve to cast doubt on the information published by state actors with a less-than-reputable track record. In short, don't bust out the celebratory champagnes just yet. We are not even close to getting the real, full pictures.  
  
5. Finally, different people have different goals in life. Some of the immaterial things that certain people long for include, but not limited to:  
→ Biological Diversity +/ Preservation of the Ecological *status quo* (^EDIT: I think Restoration to a Previous, Pre-industrial State is more accurate.)  
→ Nurturing and Maintaining Personal Relationships (love/friendship)  
→ Continuity of Humankind (what's best for the kids)  
→ Spirituality  
→ Altruism (secular)  
→ Philosophical (what most of us call ""academic"") and Artistic Achievements  
in addition to  
→ Wealth  
→ Fame  
→ Power, and  
→ Self-Indulgence  
Some people find that an infinite economic growth model is at odds with their priorities in life. I think the potential conflicts are pretty self-evident, but I can give examples if you need.

Anticonsumption,"I think there's a huge disconnect between people's words and actions. 

Many people *say* they care about climate change, but how many of them have actually taken concrete steps to reduce their impact... say, by going vegan, or zerowaste, or growing their own food, or buying an electric car instead of an SUV?  Very few.  And when you press them about it, most people have a million excuses that are usually mostly BS.

Even under a capitalist system, if people stepped up to the plate and voted with their dollars, changed their lifestyles and consumption habits, companies would be forced to follow... a company that sells things nobody's buying will either change their ways or go bankrupt.  The fact that people encourage and reward companies for their bad behavior by buying ever more ""stuff"" from them is why we are in the mess we're currently in.  

Yes, it's often inconvenient to go against the flow and NOT support companies you disagree with, but hey, no action that matters is going to be easy.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Gotta disagree with you there amigo. Chattel slavery produced agricultural products in the Americas and the Indies; conflict mineral mining in Africa for electronics manufacturing;

Neither of those are capitalist. Capitalism revolves around the VOLUNTARY exchange of goods and services.

&gt;sweatshop labor during both the industrial revolution and today in places like Thailand, China, Taiwan and Bangladesh;

I know this is a bitter pill to swallow, but there's a reason those jobs exist; because people take them voluntarily, because they are way better than the alternatives. The US and much of the developed world has comparably shitty jobs early in their history, the US for around 150 years. Countries that are developing now are probably going to develop past them in around 75 years, so that's a good deal. But the key point is this; as much as sweatshops suck, the workers there take the jobs because the alternatives suck MORE. Yes, it's hot in a sweatshop; it's damn hot out in the fields, too, where you get paid HALF as much.

&gt;prison labor producing consumer goods in the good ol' USA; the dirty deeds that Western countries did for oil in the gulf states, minerals in Chile and Brazil, rubber in Indonesia and the Philippines, and fruit in Guatemala; and the long history of genocide towards aboriginals in the entire world;

More coercion; not capitalism.

&gt;famines due to unjust wars and good old market failures while crops are sold in other countries or just chucked in the trash;

The wars are coercive, and thus not capitalist. Market failures exist, true, but they're a far inferior evil to the evils of other systems.

&gt;Oh, and climate change. Can't forget climate change.

I wouldn't want to, but that's not unique to capitalism. Do you think Mao's backyard steel mills emitted fresh air? That the 50's cars bodged together by the Cubans were powered by good wishes? That the cars used now by the members of the Twin Oaks community are even close to as efficient as the cars driven by people in the surrounding area? On the other hand, what things are being used to combat climate change? Renewable energy, carbon sequestration technologies, and the like. Where are these things getting developed? Overwhelmingly, under capitalism.

&gt;Capitalism's history is one very long chain of horrific coercion and exploitation.

That's a contradiction in terms. Capitalism, by definition, is voluntary. If you are coercing someone, that's not capitalism. Historically, that's (usually) IMPERIALISM, which stands in direct opposition to capitalism.

&gt;What we need is workers owning and operating the factories, farms, hospitals, universities and data centers where they produce all of the wealth of nations anyway, and solidarity and mutual aid between people of every corner of the globe. 

Sounds great. Capitalism allows that. You may be interested in a subset of capitalism, called ""distributism"".

&gt;So long as wealthy rent-seekers steal wages from working people, beggar the public by looting and commiting usury, and shift negative externalities from production onto the rest of the world to maximize stolen profit, we'll never EVER have ethical consumption.

All other economic systems must revolve in some way around coerced labor. Look at the common quicky description of communism: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"". Read the first half again. ""From each according to his ability"". Not according to his desire, or his preference. His ABILITY. Does X job need to be done? Does no one want to do it? Well, we can't pay anyone to do it. We won't reward them extra for doing it voluntarily (""to each according to his NEED"", remember?). So what's left? Force him to do it.

Anticonsumption,"Ah, but the exchange WAS voluntary. Powerful Europeans VOLUNTARILY pointed guns at people until they got what they wanted! ;D

All joking aside, the kind of voluntary exchange you're describing has never existed in recorded human history. A five second search on ANY news site (even Fox news or the Cato Institute) reveals documentation of horrible atrocities committed against working people. It follows then that capitalism (by your definition) has never existed, and considering the very well-documented predisposition of very wealthy individuals to behave like bastards when it comes to advancing their own goals, I'm curious what means you suggest might bring it about.

For the record I'm not endorsing the idea that Mao's China was a more environmentally friendly place to live (The situation in Cuba with the embargo is pretty nuanced and you're being reductive). However, claiming that capitalism is working to solve this problem is wrong as well. Large conglomerates have been working tirelessly to stymie efforts at environmental protection and remediation for literally a century now. For example, it was discovered that Exxon knew definitively (through internal research that they conducted) that fossil fuels were causing climate impacts as early as the 80's and spent decades funding any crackpot who would dispute this; Monsanto and ADM still dispute that glyphosate (a central nerve system toxin) is harmful to agrarian communities, the automobile manufacturers in the U.S. bought up and dismantled rail systems and continue to lobby extensively for new roads for cars; the soybean and palm oil industries continue to fell massive swaths of rain forest in Brazil and Indonesia... the list goes on. I could literally do this all day long.

So, I propose the following: if you're a business interest and you KNOW that your industry is causing ecological depletion, harming the biosphere and poisoning fish, animals and humans, and you not only CONTINUE to do so but also EXPEND tremendous amounts of CASH to obfuscate the issue and prevent any meaningful action by the public or government (and these groups have done worse than that, believe me), then you are creating devastating externalities and foisting them onto everyone else. 

As to all of the renewables and carbon sequestrations, I have two suggestions for you: one, they're completely useless at abating climate change unless we stop polluting as we are now; two, all of the original technology for these things was developed either as part of a DARPA (or European equivalent) program or at a public research university, BOTH of which are publicly funded by governments the world over. Perhaps some money has come from grants but if the rich weren't engaging in philanthropy to mask their utter misanthropy then violence would've ensued a LOT sooner, and NONE of the research required to bring these inventions about would've come from a private source because none of them want to take the financial risk or share discoveries. 

Jumping to your interpretation of that quote, you're using it pretty far out of context. The quote is attributed to a variety of sources but in this case the most likely source is Karl Marx's ""Critique of the Gotha Program"" (which I would suggest you listen to on audiobook, it's terribly dry and much easier to absorb that way). The context for it (I'm paraphrasing here so bear with me) is that once landlords, usurers and rentiers are gone and work isn't a misery anymore, once everyone can get what they need to survive without needing to subject themselves to degrading, brutal and dangerous conditions, then people will be free and can share in the bounty of industry and nature. This quote is, ironically, a very pertinent counterpoint to your argument about sweatshops.

Oxfam co-sponsored a report on the fate of sweatshop laborers a while back that found that, while these workers DO earn more than their agrarian counterparts (sometimes double), their wages often fall well below the cost of living in their countries and that, all other things remaining constant it would be anywhere from decades to centuries before the wages achieved such parity. They're on a treadmill, basically, not materially improving their conditions. Many still starve, cannot afford medicine or housing, and must endure the most inhumane conditions (see: Rana Plaza and FoxConn; I'd also recommend the wikipedia article on sweatshops which raises interesting points). The solution to their condition is not a boycott (which will actually worsen their situation) but rather worker solidarity. You should read about the triangle shirtwaist fire and what happened after that and see how improved conditions came about for workers in Europe and the USA (spoiler: it wasn't because the capitalists' hearts grew three sizes, but rather because they feared the growth of outspokenly socialist workers' groups with guns). 

I'd also suggest you read Emma Goldman's ""There is no communism in Russia"" to get an idea of the alternative I'm suggesting. Authoritarian Communism a la the USSR or Mao's China is NOT a desirable end result (interesting fun fact: None of the so-called ""Communist Bloc"" countries ever claimed to have achieved communism, but only that they were working towards it - wonder why). Mao's China and Soviet Russia both had a market (of sorts, albeit limited) but they had far more in common with the capitalist countries that exist today - namely that a very small group of people wielded tremendous power over the lives of others and did very nasty things with their armed forces.",1560970218,ah exchange voluntary powerful europeans voluntarily pointed guns people got wanted joking aside kind voluntary exchange describing never existed recorded human history five second search news site even fox news cato institute reveals documentation horrible atrocities committed working people follows capitalism definition never existed considering predisposition wealthy individuals behave bastards comes advancing goals curious means suggest might bring record endorsing idea mao china environmentally friendly place live situation cuba embargo pretty nuanced reductive however claiming capitalism working solve problem wrong well large conglomerates working tirelessly stymie efforts environmental protection remediation literally century example discovered exxon knew definitively internal research conducted fossil fuels causing impacts early spent decades funding crackpot would dispute monsanto adm still dispute glyphosate central nerve system toxin harmful agrarian communities automobile manufacturers bought dismantled rail systems continue lobby extensively new roads cars soybean palm oil industries continue fell massive swaths rain forest brazil indonesia list goes could literally day long propose business interest know industry causing ecological depletion harming biosphere poisoning fish animals humans continue also expend tremendous amounts cash obfuscate issue prevent meaningful action public government groups done worse believe creating devastating externalities foisting onto everyone else renewables carbon sequestrations two suggestions one completely useless abating unless stop polluting two original technology things developed either part darpa european equivalent program public research university publicly funded governments world perhaps money come grants rich engaging philanthropy mask utter misanthropy violence would ensued lot sooner none research required bring inventions would come private source none want take financial risk discoveries jumping interpretation quote using pretty far context quote attributed variety sources case likely source karl marx critique gotha program would suggest listen audiobook terribly dry much easier absorb way context paraphrasing bear landlords usurers rentiers gone work misery anymore everyone get need survive without needing subject degrading brutal dangerous conditions people free bounty industry nature quote ironically pertinent counterpoint argument sweatshops oxfam report fate sweatshop laborers back found workers earn agrarian counterparts sometimes double wages often fall well cost living countries things remaining constant would anywhere decades centuries wages achieved parity treadmill basically materially improving conditions many still starve afford medicine housing must endure inhumane conditions see rana plaza foxconn also recommend wikipedia article sweatshops raises interesting points solution condition boycott actually worsen situation rather worker solidarity read triangle shirtwaist fire happened see improved conditions came workers europe usa spoiler capitalists hearts grew three sizes rather feared growth outspokenly socialist workers groups guns also suggest read emma goldman communism russia get idea alternative suggesting authoritarian communism la ussr mao china desirable end result interesting fun fact none communist bloc countries ever claimed achieved communism working towards wonder mao china soviet russia market sorts albeit limited far common capitalist countries exist today namely small group people wielded tremendous power lives others nasty things armed forces

That doesn't follow at all. Just because a system CAN be abused or HAS been abused doesn't mean that such abuse is inherent.

&gt;For the record I'm not endorsing the idea that Mao's China was a more environmentally friendly place to live (The situation in Cuba with the embargo is pretty nuanced and you're being reductive). However, claiming that capitalism is working to solve this problem is wrong as well.

Of course that would be wrong. Economic systems, including capitalism, don't work to achieve such goals. PEOPLE work to achieve such goals. That alone answers the rest of that paragraph as well. Capitalism has the exact same single goal as all other economic systems; optimize the distribution of scarce resources. What constitutes ""optimum"" is a question for politics and sociology, not economics.

&gt;So, I propose the following: if you're a business interest and you KNOW that your industry is causing ecological depletion, harming the biosphere and poisoning fish, animals and humans, and you not only CONTINUE to do so but also EXPEND tremendous amounts of CASH to obfuscate the issue and prevent any meaningful action by the public or government (and these groups have done worse than that, believe me), then you are creating devastating externalities and foisting them onto everyone else. 

That depends on the meanings of some pretty squishy terms, but seems otherwise reasonable.

&gt;As to all of the renewables and carbon sequestrations, I have two suggestions for you: one, they're completely useless at abating climate change unless we stop polluting as we are now; two, all of the original technology for these things was developed either as part of a DARPA (or European equivalent) program or at a public research university, BOTH of which are publicly funded by governments the world over. 

To your first suggestion, they are part of the solution; you might as well claim that water will do nothing for a burn unless we first remove the flame. Well, yes, we need to remove the flame; but the water is a way to help do that, and it's helpful afterwards besides. To your second, no, MOST of these things were developed with government funding, but that makes them no less capitalist. A government can buy something as surely as can an individual. As to the remainder of that paragraph, you're seriously underestimating the value of privately funded research. By a LOT.

&gt;Jumping to your interpretation of that quote, you're using it pretty far out of context. The quote is attributed to a variety of sources but in this case the most likely source is Karl Marx's ""Critique of the Gotha Program"" (which I would suggest you listen to on audiobook, it's terribly dry and much easier to absorb that way).

Sounds idyllic. And naive. Life, like it or not, has dangerous parts, and unpleasant parts, and difficult parts. If you think you can run a steel mill with everyone skipping around and whistling, best of luck. If you think that crawling through a sewer pipe can ever be pleasant, well...please, volunteer for that job.

&gt;Oxfam co-sponsored a report on the fate of sweatshop laborers a while back that found that, while these workers DO earn more than their agrarian counterparts (sometimes double), their wages often fall well below the cost of living in their countries and that, all other things remaining constant it would be anywhere from decades to centuries before the wages achieved such parity.

Right so far. That bears out historical examples in what are now developed countries.

&gt;They're on a treadmill, basically, not materially improving their conditions.

But that's where you fall away from the truth. If you're getting paid more, you have more to spend. People working in sweatshops are making their countries, and themselves, wealthier. That will lead only to improvements over time. Plenty of people working in sweatshops now are living lives that are WAY better than the lives of people from a thousand years ago. And, in a couple hundred years, some wealthy people will complain that the poor, downtrodden people in the third world have to settle for only three televisions and one flying car per household.

&gt;Many still starve, cannot afford medicine or housing, and must endure the most inhumane conditions (see: Rana Plaza and FoxConn; I'd also recommend the wikipedia article on sweatshops which raises interesting points). The solution to their condition is not a boycott (which will actually worsen their situation) but rather worker solidarity.

I do think that a small group of people wield tremendous power over the lives of the masses. Under socialism? It would be way, WAY worse. That's why I prefer a free market, emphasis on the word FREE.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; It's very simple. Is someone going to inflict physical violence upon them or cause physical violence to be inflicted upon them if they do not do that job? If not, then the employer is not coercing them. Yes, the alternatives to that job are terrible in most instances. That's not the fault of the sweatshop owner. If a bunch of people are in a terrible situation, and I come along and offer a less terrible situation, that doesn't make me responsible for the original terrible situation 

It really isn't that simple, you're ignoring the fact that the terrible situation exists because of conditions created by the systems in which people live. Violent coercion can be accomplished by means other than threatening someone with a club, gun or death squad. Please consider the following:

It's not controversial to point out that some people are born into wealth and some into poverty, and that it is by far easier for those in wealth to remain in wealth than for those in poverty. This is measured by a number of different groups in the world, described as social mobility indices (which are in decline in already industrialized nations like the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, all of the EU member states, by the way).

If individuals were all born on an even playing field I could perhaps accept your reductive definition of violent coercion. However, economic insecurity does not originate merely as a result of living in this universe. It isn't controversial to say that, with current global agricultural capacity alone, we have the ability to feed literally everyone. Yet this doesn't happen, people still go hungry. Likewise the global industrial capacity is more than capable of re-tooling to provide sufficient housing, medicine and sanitation of good quality to everyone. Yet slums still exist, many in the shadow of the residences of wealthy people that can accurately be described as palatial. 

Or take the situation in the U.S. with companies like Walmart and Amazon - tremendously profitable corporations whose workers rely on food and housing assistance from government to live, who have conditions that cause chronic injury and misery, and who actively lobby to chip away at worker protections (both in law and the right to organize and petition for redress of grievance). Jeff Bezos is smart enough to know that conditions in his warehouses are inhumane and unfair, and it is literally impossible that he's unaware, and yet he persists. Sweatshop owners know the same as they benefit disproportionately from the profits their workers produce. Workers, on the other hand, take these jobs knowing they're terrible because they're forced by the system into a terrible scenario, and those who could improve their conditions by just making less money don't do so. Probably because it benefits them. This is coercion by proxy, and rent-seeking, maximizing profit at the cost of human suffering. Toil or starve is not a voluntary choice.

Global metrics detect increasing inequality globally and recently the leading global indicators of poverty have come under controversy ([Jason Hickel](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/bill-gates-davos-global-poverty-infographic-neoliberal#comment-125224072) wrote an analysis published in the guardian), not to mention that we now have to worry about climate change affecting crop yields, creating extreme weather events and flooding coastal areas. People may have more access to technology and possibly medicine (if they can afford it) but it does not follow that their lives are necessarily improving.

&gt; Presumably, the skillset necessary to be a successful CEO is quite rare. Do you really think that, if a company could get the same performance for half the cost from a different CEO, that they wouldn't jump at that deal? No board of directors is going to pass up a good shot at saving that kind of money. 

CEOs come from a variety of backgrounds, including engineering (Amazon's Bezos and Intel's Brian Krzanitch) and Ivy League business school (Pick a bank CEO). These groups don't have rare skillsets, and they're supported by armies of analysts, accountants and operations experts. I propose that skillset has little or nothing to do with it (nor even having some secondary education, as many of the robber barons of the guilded age didn't attend extensive formal schooling). CEO compensation has actually increased dramatically since the passage of law permitting compensation through stock options and the repeal of law barring stock buybacks, not decreased. Likewise, the incidence of short-sighted, risky corporate behavior has increased (I can name examples if you like). Clearly that supposition doesn't hold and there must be other reasons.

The reason that I'm citing so many examples is to construct a proof by contradiction for you. I don't consider many of the points that you've made to be uncontroversial, particularly around profit taking by investors. Kindly justify your statements, particularly around the ""creation of wealth"" by investors, their right to profit-take and wages.

I appreciate your point on dangerous jobs, I should've been more specific. With the exception of the pilot profession, most of those jobs considered low skilled labor. Licensing aside there are very few barriers to entry and many of them (particularly truckers and loggers) have highly variable compensation and employment prospects. Loggers in particular are facing an industry contraction, and truckers will follow if shipping demand contracts (which seems likely at this point). These industries also benefit tremendously from unionization (which is in decline, along with wages); As I previously mentioned, capitalist nations come down hard on efforts by labor to organize. Truckers in particular are an example of a profession whose members have entered what is now known as the precariat; they're not particularly secure in their means and are vulnerable to market conditions that have become unpredictable and unstable (many believe due to leverage in markets and risky speculation). And yes, many ex cons take up these professions (excepting taxi drivers) because the highest-paying jobs in these professions are dangerous and have so little demand that employers are desperate.

Now, pilots are an interesting case; the average salary for a pilot varies with aircraft type, from US$75k for first officers on small craft to more than US$200k for senior captains on heavy international fliers. Not bad but they're also highly unionized, and many of them are paid only for time in air and not for the auxiliary work that they do (making and logging flight plans, doing fuel calcs, etc.). They have to work hard, a lot of unpaid overtime.

As to the availability of surgeons, there's a lot of gatekeeping by the medical industry, so much so that we have a shortage of surgeons despite ample quantities of applicants for training.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;It really isn't that simple, you're ignoring the fact that the terrible situation exists because of conditions created by the systems in which people live. Violent coercion can be accomplished by means other than threatening someone with a club, gun or death squad. Please consider the following:

It's not controversial to point out that some people are born into wealth and some into poverty, and that it is by far easier for those in wealth to remain in wealth than for those in poverty. This is measured by a number of different groups in the world, described as social mobility indices (which are in decline in already industrialized nations like the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, all of the EU member states, by the way).

It's equally uncontroversial to point out that some people are born with other advantages: taller, for example, or faster, or smarter. Even if no money at all existed ever, no two people would be born in truly identical situations.

&gt;If individuals were all born on an even playing field I could perhaps accept your reductive definition of violent coercion. However, economic insecurity does not originate merely as a result of living in this universe. It isn't controversial to say that, with current global agricultural capacity alone, we have the ability to feed literally everyone. Yet this doesn't happen, people still go hungry. Likewise the global industrial capacity is more than capable of re-tooling to provide sufficient housing, medicine and sanitation of good quality to everyone. Yet slums still exist, many in the shadow of the residences of wealthy people that can accurately be described as palatial. 

Economic insecurity may not be inherent to living in the universe, but neither is economic security. Yes, some inequalities exist, but that's no less true under other economic systems. And, frankly, that's far from my primary concern. I care about how the poorest person is doing, not how far the divide is from them to the richest. If you show me two systems, one in which the poorest has just barely enough but only 1/10000th as much as the richest, and another where everyone has exactly the same but it's not enough, I'd far prefer the first system.

&gt;Or take the situation in the U.S. with companies like Walmart and Amazon - tremendously profitable corporations whose workers rely on food and housing assistance from government to live, who have conditions that cause chronic injury and misery, and who actively lobby to chip away at worker protections (both in law and the right to organize and petition for redress of grievance). Jeff Bezos is smart enough to know that conditions in his warehouses are inhumane and unfair, and it is literally impossible that he's unaware, and yet he persists. Sweatshop owners know the same as they benefit disproportionately from the profits their workers produce. Workers, on the other hand, take these jobs knowing they're terrible because they're forced by the system into a terrible scenario, and those who could improve their conditions by just making less money don't do so. Probably because it benefits them. This is coercion by proxy, and rent-seeking, maximizing profit at the cost of human suffering. Toil or starve is not a voluntary choice.

""Toil or starve"" is not a choice for which a sweatshop owner is responsible. There are other jobs that people could take in such places, and they choose not to. People LIKE those jobs over the alternatives. Are those the best jobs imaginable? Of course not, but anyone can imagine a better job. I like my job, but I can easily imagine it paying twice as much and including free cookies and milk at quitting time every day. That's not the point. The point is that I hold this job by CHOICE. And no one owes me anything more or less than that.

&gt;Global metrics detect increasing inequality globally and recently the leading global indicators of poverty have come under controversy (Jason Hickel wrote an analysis published in the guardian), not to mention that we now have to worry about climate change affecting crop yields, creating extreme weather events and flooding coastal areas. People may have more access to technology and possibly medicine (if they can afford it) but it does not follow that their lives are necessarily improving.

Average quality of life has been improving worldwide by any reasonable metric I've seen. Average age, infant mortality, education, vaccine access, etc. If you've got concrete examples to the contrary, I'd be more than interested to see them.

&gt;CEOs come from a variety of backgrounds, including engineering (Amazon's Bezos and Intel's Brian Krzanitch) and Ivy League business school (Pick a bank CEO). These groups don't have rare skillsets, and they're supported by armies of analysts, accountants and operations experts. I propose that skillset has little or nothing to do with it (nor even having some secondary education, as many of the robber barons of the guilded age didn't attend extensive formal schooling). CEO compensation has actually increased dramatically since the passage of law permitting compensation through stock options and the repeal of law barring stock buybacks, not decreased. Likewise, the incidence of short-sighted, risky corporate behavior has increased (I can name examples if you like). Clearly that supposition doesn't hold and there must be other reasons.

For example? What could possibly motivate these boards of directors to throw away so many collective billions of dollars if they're not getting anything for it?

&gt;The reason that I'm citing so many examples is to construct a proof by contradiction for you. I don't consider many of the points that you've made to be uncontroversial, particularly around profit taking by investors. Kindly justify your statements, particularly around the ""creation of wealth"" by investors, their right to profit-take and wages.

The creation of wealth by investors is obvious. If I have an idea that could net me a large profit but I am unable to implement that idea for lack of funding, it's dead in the water without investments. The investors enable the realization of my idea as surely as have I by having that idea. Sure, other investors could do the same thing and the SPECIFIC investors doesn't matter as much; but that makes the existence of SOME investor no less important. That part that they play in the creation of wealth entitles them to a profit; why should they invest in my idea for no return? What right have I to their money otherwise?

&gt;I appreciate your point on dangerous jobs, I should've been more specific. With the exception of the pilot profession, most of those jobs considered low skilled labor. Licensing aside there are very few barriers to entry and many of them (particularly truckers and loggers) have highly variable compensation and employment prospects. Loggers in particular are facing an industry contraction, and truckers will follow if shipping demand contracts (which seems likely at this point). These industries also benefit tremendously from unionization (which is in decline, along with wages); As I previously mentioned, capitalist nations come down hard on efforts by labor to organize. Truckers in particular are an example of a profession whose members have entered what is now known as the precariat; they're not particularly secure in their means and are vulnerable to market conditions that have become unpredictable and unstable (many believe due to leverage in markets and risky speculation). And yes, many ex cons take up these professions (excepting taxi drivers) because the highest-paying jobs in these professions are dangerous and have so little demand that employers are desperate.

I'll take your word for it that lots of ex-cons are finding jobs there (except that I'm kind of skeptical that they're seeking more jobs as pilots than as taxi drivers). Good. It's probably pretty hard for them to find jobs, and if they're pulling down the highest-paying jobs in these professions, that will help them avoid returning to a life of crime. I'm not sure that it's fair to claim that ""capitalist nations come down hard on efforts by labor to organize"". Look at the US; in many places and for many professions, you're required by LAW to be a member of a union to ply your trade, or at least to contribute to the relevant union financially. That doesn't sound like ""coming down hard"" to me.

&gt;Now, pilots are an interesting case; the average salary for a pilot varies with aircraft type, from US$75k for first officers on small craft to more than US$200k for senior captains on heavy international fliers. Not bad but they're also highly unionized, and many of them are paid only for time in air and not for the auxiliary work that they do (making and logging flight plans, doing fuel calcs, etc.). They have to work hard, a lot of unpaid overtime.

I'm sure they do work very hard. Again, good. I don't want some slacker pilot. I also don't want some idiot in that seat, and I doubt I'm getting one when I fly. I've met more than a few pilots, and they all seem quite intelligent enough to figure out their own career prospects.

&gt;As to the availability of surgeons, there's a lot of gatekeeping by the medical industry, so much so that we have a shortage of surgeons despite ample quantities of applicants for training. That's more of a market failure than an example.

I agree; that's a HUGE example of gatekeeping. But not of a market failure. Because who's guarding the gate? Surgeons? Not really. If I start performing surgery tomorrow, who's going to show up with a gun and stop me? Not the AMA; the government.

They don't care. Every country in European Union is overfishing. USA is overfishing. Canada, Australia, Japan - does not matter: [https://save.our.fish/endoverfishing](https://save.our.fish/endoverfishing)

Despite urges [from science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/overfishing-could-push-european-fish-species-extinction) EU set limits for fisheries over the suggested limits by researches. And on top of that every country goes beyond set limits!

Cleaning without preventing more trash first would be quite a silly task. Civilization though is good at hacks.

Research shows that activism needs to focus on end goal and not small steps. Transition period is allowed but not indefinitely. There needs to be an exact plan. So instead of telling people to stop using plastic straws we could have 12 months challenge where each month you remove next ocean's pollutant - starting from straws and ending on eating fish.

Anticonsumption,"Brief excerpts originally from [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAMasterRace/comments/c54gwq/saving_mankind_from_selfdestruction_a_repair/erzrao0) in [r/AAMasterRace](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAMasterRace/top/?t=all):

&gt; The social case is as strong [...] a mounting body of research shows that repair economies can make people happier and more humane. [...] research found repair was “helping people overcome the negative logic that accompanies the abandonment of things and people”. Repair made “late modern societies more balanced, kind and stronger”. It was a form of care, of “healing wounds”, binding generations of humanity together.
&gt; 
&gt; British anthropologist Daniel Miller [observed](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Y9EN45B7nR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Daniel+Miller%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja4t34oOPiAhVRX30KHReGChMQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) residents who fixed their kitchens. Those with strong and fulfilling social relationships were more likely to do so; those with few and shallow relationships less likely.
&gt; 
&gt; Miller is among many scholars who have observed that relationships between people and material things tend to be reciprocal. When we restore material things, they serve to restore us.
&gt; 
&gt; Repair economies don’t regard material things as expendable. [...] By contrast, consumer economies encourage us to relate with products in ways that damage the planet and promote a kind of learned helplessness.

Right to repair was first lost when consumers started tolerating proprietary batteries. Then proprietary non-replaceable batteries (NRB's). Then disposable devices. Then pre-paid charging. Then pay per charge. It keeps getting worse. The only way to stop it is to go back to the beginning and eliminate the proprietary NRB's. Before you can regain the right to repair, you first need to regain the right to open your device and put in new batteries.

There are 2 subreddits committed to ending the reign of proprietary NRB's:

* [r/AAMasterRace](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAMasterRace/top/?t=all)
* r/18650masterrace

When right to repair activists succeed, it's on the basis revoking right to repair is a monopolistic practice, against the principles of healthy capitalism. Then, legislators and regulators can see the need to eliminate it, and the activists win. No company ever went out of business because of it. If it's a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules, the businesses succeed or fail for meaningful reasons, like the price, quality and diversity of their products, not whether they require total replacement on a pre-determined schedule due to battery failure.

Taking this idea a step further, the thought crossed my mind the hypothetical threat of an AI apocalypse relies on technology advancing to a point where we can no longer understand it. Proprietary non-replaceable batteries (NRB's) were the first step in the trend toward the ""learned helplessness"" the article is talking about. When we can't even replace the batteries, we have already lost control over our technology, just like predictions of AI apocalypse warned us about. It seems to me, that's an obvious path to eventual destruction in an actual AI apocalypse.

On the other hand, if our technology is completely under our control, it will eventually cease functioning without our maintenance. Mankind and our technology must both advance at the same pace, and there is no threat of an AI apocalypse.

So, basically: Save your stuff, save the world.

Anticonsumption,"I have a personal crackpot theory that humans have a fundamental need or instinct to work with their hands. 

I've worked in tech for decades, and from what I can tell, a lot of and maybe most people reach a point within a couple of years where they feel compelled to take up some kind of handicraft or other manual hobby. Woodworking, needlework, gardening, cooking, restoring cars, brewing beer, whatever. Even if they'd never had any interest before.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;So you don’t assume the US is a democracy, yet you also believe that voters want endless warfare, because that is who they keep electing? Your two points contradict each other.

No, they don't. The US is not a democracy in the classical sense, in that it's not a pure direct democracy. That being said, it IS a mixed republic with representative democracy. Calling it ""a democracy"" is overly simplistic to the point of being incorrect, but we absolutely DO elect our representatives and our president (this last albeit in a rather imbalanced and undemocratic fashion). We're far, FAR closer to a democracy that a plutocracy; a rich man gets exactly the same number of votes as a poor man: one. And actually, when it comes to the Presidency, the rich functionally get FEWER votes than the poor, thanks to the imbalances in the electoral college.

&gt;70% of US citizens think the government should do more to combat climate change. Yet the government continues to favour fossil fuels, warfare and environmental deregulation. 

It's almost as if people don't vote for what they claim to want in the polls. Maybe those 70% want something else MORE. Or maybe, just maybe, a whole bunch of people keep telling them that it's ""not their fault"". So why vote for anything, since ""their votes don't matter""?

Anticonsumption,"I'm worried about both. They are both forms of ""infinite growth on finite planet"".

You could make humans super-sustainable, and if the population continues to grow you still going to need more consumption of water, food, housing, medical, sewage, clothes, etc.

There is no such thing as ""sustainable infinite growth"". It just can't be done. It's complete rejection of reality.

Please stop with this bullshit that we can just magically increase human population with no side effects. Yes, the top 20% (which includes YOU, assuming you live in a house) are consuming way too much. If you wiped out all those folks, consumption would drop and that would be great, but we'd still need to feed everyone, water them, etc. If human population continued to increase we'd end up right back in same place we are now simply due to crazy numbers of people.

The other thing to factor in is that all it takes is a famine or two to cause some major food shortages and mass starvation. We've been lucky so far, or, more accurately, we've screwed over lots of poor countries and let them starve instead (eg. Yemen, all of Africa at one time or another, etc). But with 7.7 BILLION people, we are just begging for unimaginable death toll from the next famine. Oh, look, there's climate change... Guess what that does to crops?

BTW, the reason the top 20% consume so much is down to the factories, mines, etc., that they own or part of that supply chain. And all that stuff, all that ecocide, war, inequality, etc., is primarily caused by trying to feed, house, clothe, water, healthcare, educate, transport, etc., the 7.7 BILLION humans that already exist.

Currently population is growing at something like 250,000 additional humans PER DAY. That's factoring in the death rate. So you've got 1/4 million new mouths to feed every day. And provide water to. And clothes. And sanitation. And..... You get the picture.

I don't know where you're from, but that's like an extra London (UK) or New York (USA) of humans PER MONTH. You really think adding that many humans per month is sustainable? Really?!

It doesn't matter much if they're rich or poor, black or white, straight or gay, east or west, or anything else. The simple fact of the matter is that this planet simply cannot sustain infinite growth of human population even if we had a button that made everyone magically join the anti-consumption movement overnight.

Both issues need to be tackled. Anything that is even a small percentage growth is essentially infinite growth. And we cannot have infinite growth on planet of finite resources. That's just not possible with physical reality, sorry.

So please stop spreading this false and utterly asinine notion that overpopulation isn't a problem. Just because a bunch of nazis use the issue to promote their sick and fetid agendas doesn't mean the issue doesn't exist. You have to separate those two things. Nazis will make anything shit, that's what nazis do. They took a symbol of spirituality / good luck and turned it in to the emblem of holocaust. They are pure evil. But just because they are sick bastards doesn't mean you can start ignoring overpopulation.

Anticonsumption,"Edit: Now that I am back at a computer, I'm adding in links to my info. I found out even more about inefficient farm usage!

Off the top of my head, Almonds and pistachios use a lot of water. In fact the almond groves in Kern county California are attributed as one of the reasons why the drought lasted so long, Because so much water was diverted to farmland.

[https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/wheres-californias-water-going/](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/wheres-californias-water-going/)

I did not realize crops such as Broccoli and Tomatoes still use so much water! (these figures represent the amount needed for 100% irrigated water). This is a particularly important caveat in California, as much of the farmland there is in areas with little to no natural irrigation or rainfall. So even if vegetables have a lower carbon footprint and water usage, that is essentially negated if you're going to use infrastructure to divert rivers and pump water onto crops because they're simply being planted in the wrong places. You also have to factor in herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers used. This is a result of factory farming. A large corporation will do whatever is needed to make their land suit their needs, as opposed to traditional farming where farmers sought out already fertile and wet land for their needs, and largely grew crops that were best suited for that region. 

In fact, water use in farmland in general is super inefficient for any kind of trees. Because the sprinklers are spraying everything around the tree and not just the tree. A farmer in Florida actually invented a cone to put around each tree to drastically reduce water usage.

This is called the ""Tree T-PEE"", and not only does it reduce water usage, but it reduces fertilizer usage by 75%, and reduces herbicide usage by even more since there are less weeds due to less fertilizer.

[https://www.treetpee.com/our-story/](https://www.treetpee.com/our-story/)

Cotton uses a lot of water and resources as well. It's still currently the most popular vegan friendly option for clothing. Most of the world's cotton is grown in India where the farmers are forced to use pesticides and other chemicals banned in Europe and the US. Cancer rates in these farming communities have increased sharply as a result.

Information on Cotton's water usage:

[https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/cotton](https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/cotton)

Information on toxic chemical use in India:

And you also presume wrong. Our animal consumption does need to drastically decrease for health and environmental reasons. But if we went back to smaller family farms and butcheries, to supply a smaller demand, much of the abuse and mistreatment of animals will go away as it is tied to factory farming. (For example owning a couple of free range chickens for your eggs as opposed to factory run hatcheries) I've personally cut my animal consumption in half. I think this is a much more realistic and affordable goal for most people. Humans are omnivores. If we weren't supposed to be, then we wouldn't have incisors or canines.

I think for the most part we should see a shift to more local and community based farming or co-ops. This will ensure that only what is needed is grown, and will cut out CO2 emissions from shipping it all across the world.

My issue is with the idea that if you're not vegan then you don't care about the world, or that if you are vegan then you are making such a big difference as individual choices are not going to change things much unless you're a part of the top 10% being extremely wasteful. Also as I mentioned veganism doesn't address any of the many human rights issues involved with all food production. If you want to be vegan for health or other personal reasons then great! But it is not going to change things to the extent that we need them to, so this misinformation needs to stop.

Make no mistake, the companies that are directly responsible for climate change do not want us to focus on them because it will affect their bottom line.

If your argument is purely moralistic as opposed to materialist then you should state that clearly but know you're much less likely to convince people, for instance I value human life over animal life, full stop.

Anticonsumption,"Karl Marx advocated for the abolition of private property, not personal property. You're still allowed to have ""things"", but the means of production, factories, farms, ect ect would become property of the state and instead of serving the few (ie the bourgeois) it would serve the common people.

That's still a solution that would involve the nation state to exist. Peter Kropotkin in *The Conquest of Bread* advocated for the seizure of the means of production, but rather than be controlled by the state it would be controlled by the people at large.

I digress.

One thing that people might consider a violation of human rights, would be to remove them from their big houses, and make them live in a much smaller residence such as an apartment.

Seizing cars that are deemed inefficient and more damaging to the environment might be considered by some to be a violation of human rights.

But in my view they really aren't. It might suck, but it's not a violation of human rights.

There is no solution in my mind that would work while capitalism still exists.

Barring people from entering the country is a violation of human rights. When it's too late to reverse the effects, or at a minimum mitigate the effects of climate change things are going to change and change fast.

Anticonsumption,"Work eat shit sleep, and never miss a second of your favorite Netflix Special®

But seriously, the next wave of pure market fundamentalism will be even more aggressive towards non-market values and activities.  Assuming we take this logic to it’s end, we could be facing a few possible scenarios:

- Public schools have been stripped of all public funding, and now relies solely on individual students/customers to each pay a fee for the service of education.  This would also keep the lower classes from receiving a fair right to education.  

- Even further, any funding which goes to public services would be off the table, as funding slowly diminishes.  Public park fees will be increased, while they will be exploited by corporations to build their own properties, extract resources, etc.  Public transportation will be very expensive, water fountains will disappear, the EPA will have been so far corrupted that there would be no need to filter water or ensure clean and breathable air.  Now, it’s only the INDIVIDUAL that has to look out for themselves.  After all, public goods are meant for the leeches.  

-  Because of the advancement in technology, market power begins to erode as industries continue to die off and become irrelevant.  In turn, we will come up with more ways to charge people for basic necessities, including air consumption, CO2 emission, and an “existence tax.”  We’ll charge you for your own garden, your rain water, your solar grid, your own fertilizer, and any semblance of off-the-grid living.  If you ain’t contributing to the market, you’re an anti-American terrorist that needs re-adjustment.  

- Additionally, we will continue on to create jobs out of purely economic reasons.  Instead of robots doing our jobs, we will buy our own robots to go to work for us.  Jobs will have to keep going, even tho the job sector consists of mostly freelance gig work and robot maintenance.  

- We may all see, in our lifetime, an explosion of anti-climate change propaganda before the implosion of the system.  It may get to a point where there is nothing left for the market to grab onto and will resort to information wars or downright authoritarian policies in order to survive.  It will fight until it hangs on it’s last thread, where it will become desperate to preserve itself.  

-  The future may exhibit a society where public discourse and fact-based logical reasoning are absent, even in politics.  All intellectuals, artists, free-thinkers, or “citizens of dissent” will be vilified and discredited, labeled as terrorists, or simply “muted” by powers in the tech/economic/political industries.

-  We will further entrench the powers of the prison state by creating more customers for them, aka more mundane activities and actions become illegal.  Even children will not be spared, who are seen merely as customers for our new child prisons.  

-  Instead of serving the public good, the future mantra becomes “Extract as much credit from society as possible,” and with the help of surveillance technology, we will charge citizens for every infraction that incurs, day and night.  Once we can read thoughts, we’ll figure out a way to charge for those illegal thoughts and ideas.  

- Any deviation or protest against market logic becomes borderline illegal, and labels you an enemy of the state.  Grow your own garden? Dissenter.  Talk about sustainable, anti consumption methods? Enemy of the state.

&gt;This is not capitalism; quite the opposite.

It is. And these are just the violent ones, nevermind the deception and corruption in developed countries.

&gt; That depends. Did the farmers sell voluntarily?

Nope. Unclaimed lands sold by the government. Companies evict local farmers and cause huge food insecurity.

&gt; That doesn't actually describe all that many people. Are there people in poverty? By MODERN standards, yes. And in the third world, even by reasonable historical standards.

There's a reason that the directors are the directors. They make the kinds of decisions that drive the factory forward.

I apologize for nothing, but I do advocate for capitalism. And I'm the first to admit that it has its problems, and not just in practice but in theory as well. I don't claim, and never have, that capitalism is perfect; merely that it's better than the alternatives.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;  And it's naive to imagine that ethics are coupled to socioeconomic status.

Yes that is why the ethics of multinational corporations is world-renowned. No oil spills, buried climate change studies, habitats destroyed, child labourers employed or death squads hired, amirite? Capitalism is all of the aforementioned my man.

&gt; Under a system of centralized control, the decisions about what to make and what not to make are absolute.

A company is a centralised system of control. A worker owned company can decide the direction of a company, a shareholder owned company is at the whims of out-of-touch billionaires. And in a capitalist system a company can lobby politicians to do all sorts of horrible shit like not enforcing pollution laws. And before you say that's not capitalism, it is.

&gt; Companies want nothing; a company has no mind, no desires, no thoughts. PEOPLE want things. PEOPLE can act unethically. A company does not

Yes and guns don't kill people, people kill people, right? My man you can disagree with me on that regard, but sorry to say, Coca-Cola still hired death squads, Chiquita still overthrew central american governments, Nestlé still killed babies so they can make an extra million or two. This is peak capitalism. It's what capitalism is. Evil. Money is all that matters and it's always been this way, I don't care if a couple ten million become Vegan or boycott Nestlé. Ethical consumption is impossible under capitalism. Even now with the knowledge of the internet, even AMERICAN companies directly hurting AMERICAN people are profiting. This is capitalism. I don't see how it's hard to understand this.

&gt; People lived sustainable lives for a very, very, very long time throughout history, and they were much poorer than they are now.

Yes and back then they weren't headed to total climate collapse. If you're defending climate collapse with the fact that people in India can buy a couple bags of chips now, it ain't a vert strong argument. This point is useless though, I don't care what happened before, even Marxists believe capitalism is a necessary step before communism. What I'm saying is that sustainability and ethical consumption are impossible under capitalism. Which they aren't. 

&gt; No, I just understand that most people have a desire for a standard of living that they cannot sustainably afford; they overconsume.

No dude, the majority of the world is really poor. Most people in underdeveloped countries do not have the money nor time to think about being sustainable. 3 billion people live on less than $2.5 a day, 80% of humans live on $10 a day or less... they can't afford vegan whole foods unprocessed avocado loaf or whatever. You're just privileged enough to live in the part of the world that exploits, not the one being exploited. 

&gt; And yet many people do neither of those things. Many people don't engage in wage labor, and are perfectly alive and healthy.

In NA and EU maybe... 8 million people die of starvation every year. And even in developed countries you'll live a shitty life if you're poor and don't or can't work.

&gt; We'll see.

I hope not, given that a century of letting evil corporations loose has set us on the course of reaching a 6 degree increase by 2100. Yay for capitalism. Sure we went extinct, but hey, we had a CHOICE in it.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Yes that is why the ethics of multinational corporations is world-renowned. No oil spills, buried climate change studies, habitats destroyed, child labourers employed or death squads hired, amirite? Capitalism is all of the aforementioned my man.

And do you imagine that all managers do such things, and that no blue-collar workers do?

&gt;A company is a centralised system of control. 

That, under capitalism, people can choose to participate in or not.

&gt;A worker owned company can decide the direction of a company, a shareholder owned company is at the whims of out-of-touch billionaires. 

Only if the only shareholders are these out-of-touch billionaires. Regular folks can also be shareholders.

&gt;And in a capitalist system a company can lobby politicians to do all sorts of horrible shit like not enforcing pollution laws. And before you say that's not capitalism, it is.

If you like.

&gt;Yes and guns don't kill people, people kill people, right? 

Correct.

&gt;My man you can disagree with me on that regard, but sorry to say, Coca-Cola still hired death squads, Chiquita still overthrew central american governments, Nestlé still killed babies so they can make an extra million or two. This is peak capitalism. It's what capitalism is. Evil. Money is all that matters and it's always been this way, I don't care if a couple ten million become Vegan or boycott Nestlé. Ethical consumption is impossible under capitalism. Even now with the knowledge of the internet, even AMERICAN companies directly hurting AMERICAN people are profiting. This is capitalism. I don't see how it's hard to understand this.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Controlling things on the lowest level possible, by its very nature, maximizes accountability.

Very much agree. I advocate for a workplace &gt; regional union &gt; state union &gt; global union form of government. There are many things, like zoning laws, infrastructure maintenance, workplace conditions, and what is considered ""acceptable behaviour"" that are better suited to more localised government. I think that there are also things that are much better suited to global bodies, like resource delegation, action on climate change, production targets for industrial equipment, maintenance of global systems and so on.

&gt;I think it really hit me last Sunday morning as I was driving my 5 kids back to our home after we had breakfast at the local diner (it's a weekly tradition for all of us to get the Hungry Man breakfast of Steak &amp; Eggs with sides of ham and bacon). My mind had been drifting as the kids squabbled in the back (we have a huge SUV so I actually feel kind of removed from them as we drive). The long drive back to our home in the countryside gives me time to think, so I don't mind the hour long round trip I make in to the city I seem to make almost every day (I also get to glance over the snowmobile trails where we ride in the winter and the lake we go speedboating on in the summer, which is nice!). Anyway, I started thinking about how corporations were really wrecking the planet, as I'd learned on Reddit that they are responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions, which were causing rampant global warming. It was hard to believe at first, but the more I thought on it I realized that it was true.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later on, when I got home to our big 4500 sq.ft. house, I almost felt like I could feel the avarice of those bastards and the people controlling them weighing down upon me and my family. I could almost see their emissions of carbon filling the air. I decided to retire to my outdoor hot tub (really pleasant in the winter) to think more on it. It was their profit motive, their rapacious greed driving the destruction of our Earth. I wanted to help, to do something to contribute to making the world more sustainable, but I had also read on reddit that changing individual behavior wasn't even worth contemplating in the face of what corporations were doing to the planet. The three hamburgers I ate for lunch tasted like ash in my mouth, the roast lamb for dinner not much better, and not even distracting myself with movies on our big screen TVs, numerous computers and iPads, or perusing all my photo albums (we try to fly to a different part of the world every few months) could make me feel better. I didn't want to take my sports car out for a drive in the winter, which could have made me feel better. Cranking the heat up in my house barely got rid of the chills I felt as I fretted about the lack of control I had to effect corporate carbon emissions.

And you can not, absolutely can not reach those people through preaching and demanding. Some will instantly tune you out, and some will actively fight back against your message. You need to go softly softly, you need to lead them down the path by the hand, showing them step by step that it's not hard, they can do this.

Anticonsumption,"I'm not questioning whether eating fish is right or wrong everyone in there knows that the fish and meat industry are causing harm to the planet. I'm questioning methods here. Getting angry, aggressive, and as close-minded as the ones that refuse to make a slight change in their diet will have a reverse effect and instead of making people change for a better lifestyle and way of consumption, you'll get them stuck in the ""fuck those crazy aggressive vegans I can eat what I want!"" mindset. You also underestimate how dependents are some third world countries to the fish or meat industry to survive. You can't tell to those people to think long term. As I said earlier, you are delusional if you think you can change the way people think in a few years. You are also delusional if you think being aggressive and trying to make them feel guilty will change anything at all. It will take decades to change the mindset that took decades to be shaped the way they are now. I'm not optimistic on our changes but at our scale, the best thing we can do is educate people. I wasn't told using fossil fuels was bad when I was a kid. It was the norm. People were scared of wind turbines and were saying it was too ugly to become a solution. I'm only 22 so that was like 15 years ago. It took everyone time to realize how bad it was and now I educate my younger brother (5y/o) on climate change and actions to take. I try to tell to my surrounding that eating meat twice a day doesn't make sense and it wouldn't hurt their health to cut it down. I try to tell them to consume responsibly. Not all of them are listening but some are and they are making changes which makes me happy especially knowing that I live in a rural area where it's hard to make elders changes their habits when they have lived all their life the same way. Now could you imagine what would've happened if I told them they were twats without any consideration ? They would've told me to fuck off and that would be it. It's good to want to change the world for the better but it's not happening if you have no patience, no understanding of your surroundings and of your history and it's especially not happening if you have no empathy nor any humbleness.

Anticonsumption,"None of the above since I am not a US citizen. I am an independent environmental consultant and work for various different companies on a project basis. I am not trying to whip out my dick and have a measuring contest; but it really irritates me when people who clearly don’t know what the hell they’re talking about get on their moral high horse and start yelling at other people to change now or else. That simply doesn’t work. You should know that as a scientist considering the amount of pushback Issues like climate change get.  And no, I’m not trying to divert, I just mention my “accolade” as you call it - I prefer to refer to it as my education and experience, which I worked hard to achieve, just like you - because I believe it adds some weight to my educated opinion.  Do you also have a problem with climate scientists mentioning their “accolades” during a climate debate?

Let me ask you a question: why is it that you are only focused on the US? There is a whole other world outside of the US and Britain. People on their moral high horse (usually in the US) are so western centric that they think that a model that can apply in your country can apply everywhere else in the world.

Look, in the end we are on the same team. I advocate for change and I have been doing so for a few decades now. But somewhere along the way I realized the being a moralist, yelling at people, insulting them and belittling them to try and exact change from them simply does not work. It may work in a few instances but generally people will push back and do the opposite of what you want them to because that is human nature. I am in no way throwing up excuses for not changing our ways; all I’m saying is that Aggressively attacking people because they have habits that you think ( and rightfully so)are harmful to the planet is not going to change their mind.

And to answer your questions as to why I’m not vegan: I used to be, and got bored with it. Additionally, I have been jaded due to being surrounded in the past by idiots who think that their vegan way of life is the only possible solution to all the ills of the world.  They are sanctimonious pricks. Also, I think a vegan diet is a shitty diet personally.  But that is just my opinion.

Anticonsumption,"That's not what I mean, greed is a part of human nature &amp; capitalism is an economic system to cater to that. But just like we can control greed to a meaningful degree on an individual level, I believe the issue of over-consumption in society can be managed without having to turn to a central planned economy because we all have the liberty of choice, e.g. rejecting fast fashion in favour of socially responsible companies or rejecting fossil fuel energy for green energy. 

This is a big one, it doesn't sound like it's much but it could work on a macro scale. Choice for individuals in society is influenced by many factors including social determinants such as trending movements, cultural values &amp; peer pressure; economic determinants such as cost &amp; availablity which is possible with government intervention (carbon-tax, carbon pricing, banning advertisements in public places etc) &amp; plenty of others. We're also on the brink of developing new technology which could maintain sustainable production, I believe capitalism is the most effective method of technological development.

The only way to stop climate change is to stop burning fossil fuels &amp; taking care of the environment. A centrally planned economy may curb over consumption but that's all. Bolivia (centrally planned economy with some private organisations) is an example, it has a massive deforestation problem, their main exports are mining &amp; petroleum - both are destructive industries.

If you have a valid, worthwhile objection to the idea, challenge it, don't silence it by force.

Unfortunately most people are not critical thinkers. I support the censorship of things like white supremacy, because unfortunately these ideas can be very seductive to certain people, and those same people will choose not to look at information that challenges it. 

There is also the issue that in the modern era it is much easier to find an audience. You can broadcast to thousands or millions of people, online, without ever having to be challenged.

Anticonsumption,"TLDR; Basically, world leaders, billionaires, and regular citizens need to change their mind about what is really important in life and society:

health (for all), happiness (for all), and technological progress (the good kind of progress). Or some variation of these things.

The majority of people today, as this forum knows all too well, are rushing to get as much sex, feel-good drugs, alcohol, and material possessions for their selves. Unsustainable hedonistic greed.

Until everyone sees what is truly important, the only progress the world will make will be coincidental or a result of people who know what matters—which are few and far between.

A couple ways to get everyone on the same page are to educate the young (those who are still open minded) and start encouraging the use of psychedelics (FOR ADULTS, NOT KIDS, OBVIOUSLY). Kids are able to see things with an open mind and so they only need to be educated on the issues of our time to be motivated to solve them. As for adults, psychedelics are the only drug that can put them in the same state of mind as when they were kids, and because of this, they make people reconsider their ideologies and lifestyle choices. 

Ironically, the open minded states produced by psychedelics are what is needed to move towards legalization... this is a really big hurdle to get over.

Anyhow, if everyone had the same goal in mind (health, happiness, technology) the brightest minds of the world would come up with a better plan for the climate crisis than we could ever conceive of. Imagine if you took all the talent currently being used to develop the next PlayStations, iPhones and GMO soybeans and instead used it to stop climate change? And moreover, what if these efforts had public support? It’s fun to think about...

If people weren’t obsessed with reality TV, social media, video games and the next generation supercars maybe we would see that happen.

At least this is my take ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ who really knows. I have no scientific evidence on hand to support these ideas but they appeal to my intuition and experience.

Personally, I’m just going to do my best to live my life how I believe everyone else should. Buying food local organic and unpackaged. Not buying useless shit. And just being as eco conscious as possible and live happily. If I wouldn’t have ever took psychedelics, I would still be climbing the corporate ladder in a rat race like everyone else.

It’s extraordinarily difficult to successfully educate children when you’re competing with billion dollar corporations: Ronald Mcdonald, video game streamers, advertising, ignorant parents, this is an endless list.

If not, I’m interested in the world you’d prefer to live in, what it’d look like.
If no fashion is allowed to be produced, then I assume functionality would be the only criteria. Like military uniforms (which still differs across the world, because a designer has been hired for every single produced military garment as well).

So, one color (who’s to pick color?), one width of the pants, one width and length of the shirt. Maybe they should come in different thicknesses for different seasons? Or are we more of a layering type of global population?
Should the clothes come in different materials for different geographic locations? I’m thinking heavy canvas for northern regions and maybe linen for around the equator. Various materials and thicknesses for everything in between..

Then altered pieces for various professions, welders and nurses might not benefit from wearing the exact same clothes for work.

Who is going to design the uniforms? One design team for the entire planet? 

What should we do about the people that then decides to maybe purchase a pair of pants not made for their region while on vacation in a warmer place? Will they be confiscated upon entry of colder region? Or should they be allowed to be kept but not used until once again entering a region appropriate for the pants?

What if the nurse decides to wear his wife’s welding coat when going grocery shopping? Should that be considered a crime? What could the nurse be facing? Fines or imprisonment?

A world completely without fashion is just as impossible as it is an interesting thought experiment, maybe even an nice plot for a movie..

Anticonsumption,"&gt;I hope you understand that everything and anything can be taken as fashion.

I do understand that. Just as just about any words CAN be taken as an insult. But society would generally be better off discarding the idea of fashion.

&gt;Or do you rather see that we all flock around the equator and wear nothing at all?

No, I'd rather we wore clothes for their functionality.

&gt;If not, I’m interested in the world you’d prefer to live in, what it’d look like. If no fashion is allowed to be produced, then I assume functionality would be the only criteria. Like military uniforms (which still differs across the world, because a designer has been hired for every single produced military garment as well).

If you really think that military uniforms are produced with functionality as the primary concern, you've never spent much time wearing them.

As to the rest of your wall of text, I never claimed or suggested that absolute uniformity was the appropriate goal. Yes, there are appropriate differences, because different garments serve different functions. There's no particular reason to have one design team, and I see no reason to use the law to enforce any of this (and it's frankly odd that your mind went the way of confiscation and criminality).

Anticonsumption,"Not trying to be fallacious. You're acknowledging my overall point, which I know is broad, that we've been in some fashion geo-engineering the Earth since development of agriculture and when we started burning fossil fuels, etc. I think Yang's overall point is that we've got to be realistic: are we going to keep redeveloping in areas that get ravaged by hurricanes and floods and rising sea level? Or should we get ahead of that a bit, knowing we're going to have to deal with global warming impacts for some time even with (hopefully) drastically reducing emissions worldwide, and help people adjust to the changing conditions? That's where his ""pessimism"" seems to be based, but it seems pretty realistic to me. I think it's good that he's not like all the other candidates, saying so confidentially that we will succeed. We don't know if we'll succeed, but he sure hopes we do (he has said he will do everything he can as a father). 

You mentioned the international perspective, which will almost undoubtedly result in strategies resembling geo-engineering, if we are able to work with a significant number of countries in this fight. You've probably heard of efforts like the ""Great Green Wall,"" to stop the spread of the Sahara desert by planting millions of trees ([https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/world/trillion-trees-climate-change-intl-scn/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/world/trillion-trees-climate-change-intl-scn/index.html)). World-wide geo-engineering will continue regardless of who is President of the US. 

I can agree that's a bit of a fallacious argument but it's also quite specific to call Yang an Eco-fascist.  I think we could agree that many governments are going to have some tough issues to deal with as sea levels rise, people run out of water, fires run rampant, etc. How do we help everyone without strong government action?

I think Yang and Sanders are not too far off in the grand scheme of things, on environmental issues and other economic issues. As you mention, Yang could take lessons from Sanders on going after international oil companies. Aerosols could be a disaster, but we may need to entertain all ideas. We're on the same team overall though. Yang just has some fresh ideas on the impacts of automation that the Yang camp believes Sanders is missing. A minimum wage of $15 for all doesn't help if that accelerates job loss due to companies automating even faster to get rid of that more expensive labor. Sanders has not addressed this to my knowledge. The fact that we're both in an Anticonsumption subreddit shows how close we are in ideology, relatively.

Anticonsumption,"I just want to be clear here, I call Yang an eco-fascist because he wants to continue domination over the natural world, he wants to uphold a system based on domination and exploitation which give a mirror image onto our environmental perspectives, he is a capitalist through and through no matter how much his UBI helps his case, a lot of his economic positions are built off capitalist ideology of growth, of an insatiable trust for the market and in a similar fashion science as a moral system (its not). Geo-Engineering like the Sahara tree thing absolutely a terrible idea, not only for the emission costs in its production but also of the continued creation of monocultures in its ecosystem. What an international perspective that would help, would be the expansion of safe farming practices like holistic management in areas of increased desertification, the clean up of littered waters across the world, international pressure to cut down on high carbon-emitting states like those out of China and India (China abides by their Paris Agreement standards we do not), to help build up the African world's sustainable energy and economies (this starts by prohibiting American investors to expropriate wealth from a destitute populous say of requiring a CBA with foreign workers.) None of these things involve a capitalization of market potential, no investors but the general population,

Automation is an issue although I do not see its future in anything but removing truckers, taxi drivers, fast-food employees, etc. A solution would be to reinvest the public in higher education say of programming which I do not see being automated in the foreseeable future. But this issue does need the measures that Yang calls for (I honestly don't see his freedom dividend being in equilibrium in the budget), that non-equilibrium will cause massive inflation high deficit spending and to attempt to make it balances in the budget it would require higher taxes not only on huge corporations but also the working populous, this plan would cost trillions which need to be remade in revenue again which I do not see. Not to mention the real possibility that rent would just go up to $1,000.

Yes, you are on my side, you understand the earth is in danger, but you should also realize the extreme danger in avoiding the social issues which created this crisis which has done little to help and a lot to avoid the coming crisis. But I would want to make clear, as I think all climate activists should know that sea-level rise is quite literally the least of our concerns in regards to climate change, because yes you can become a refugee because your house was flooded and that is an issue but you can't run away totally from hunger. Famine from drought will be the largest concerns as those regions become inhospitable and currently scarce foodstuffs will begin to dwindle even more. This will cause an innumerable human rights abuses to emerge, from war, land acquisition by warlords, the reactionary governments these people flee into putting them in unsanitary spaces, to the angry populous which has been directed towards these vulnerable groups.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;I assume you are an American. Your society went from hating anything that had communism in its name to glorifying it now. Can't you see that there is something fundamentally wrong with your society and whatever system you throw at it it's going to break?

No, I'm British actually.

&gt;Why don't you start talking about your urban sprawling problem

Unrestricted growth should be... Restricted. 

&gt;your huge house in the suburbs

Considering you believe I'm American, we'll talk America - There is almost SIX times the number of vacant homes in America than there is a homeless population in America. That's underconsumption and overproduction. That's a different problem to this sub, and yet still a capitalist crisis.

&gt;your everyday car commute/ your complete inability to create public transit.

It's not just *creating* public transport, it's getting people to use it over cars. Nationalised, free and efficient public transport would get people to use it over personal transport.

 &gt;Why don't you try solving these problems first instead of changing your whole system into a loosely based set of ideas

Not sure why Marx is considered loosely based but Smith isn't.

&gt;that have failed multiply in the past.

If you built something that could absorb CO2 and convert it into something useful, and then someone came along and bashed it to pieces, did it fail, or was it destroyed?

Socialist countries faced trade embargoes, multiple coup attempts, election tampering and wars. Severely limiting the economy of a country like they do in Cuba does not mean socialism failed.
Murdering a socialist president and then installing a murderous neo-liberal fascist in their place as they did in Chile does not mean socialism failed.
Reducing a country to rubble through war like in Vietnam or Korea does not mean socialism failed. Some of these places where able to get by with help from the USSR and China. Chile didn't because Allende was killed.

 &gt;Why don't you do that? Because it is not sexy? 

Unsure what that means.

&gt;Or maybe because it is harder than blaming plastic 

Okay yeah it's plastic at fault. Never use plastic again. Ban plastic straws. Except companies will continue to produce and consume tonnes of plastic. Consumers are NOT the main users of plastic, companies are. But let's ban plastic straws rather than fight the bigger problems.

&gt;or even worse, capitalism.

Good place to review here. The points you raised singularly (housing, sprawling, transport, plastic) are all problems of the larger system. You can go ahead and put in as many restrictions as you want through Congress or parliament, but that won't fight the root problem. Taxes are legally required to be paid, but companies get away with not doing it. Why do you think that will change it. And even then you're just going to see another Reagan or Thatcher come along and repeal all the laws and regulations just like those 2 did before. Because capitalism is unstable.

 &gt;Isn't that ignorant?

No

Eternal economic growth as a goal for GDP is the problem. What we actually *need* to survive right now is for GDP and consumer spending to drop drastically.

Basically this: Unless it's *absolutely necessary* for health and safety, for bringing CO2 levels down in the 10-year window or for the smooth transition to a post-CO2 society, it shouldn't be sourced, processed, manufactured, shipped, retailed and purchased.

If we were serious-- and we should be-- no new home/building construction, no beef or dairy (or perhaps any meat), no new clothes, no aisles and aisles of packaged foods and cleaning products, no new furniture, no decorative trinkets, no stores full of crap for parties and decorating your house at the holidays, no gas-powered landscaping, no lawns or lawncare treatments, no new gas stoves or boilers, no whatever the fuck your about to order online, no military industrial complex, no nonessential air travel, etc., etc., etc., etc.

1. Environmental restoration needs to be as profitable as the military industrial complex is. Right now, climate change is a bigger threat to our civilization than any overseas ""enemy."" 

2. Health *maintenance* needs to be a bigger industry than pharmaceuticals and hospitals. If we all switch to a properly balanced vegetarian or vegan diet, disease rates drop drastically. Throw regular exercise into the mix and you've made an even bigger impact. Health clubs should all be federally funded. And dietary clinics, counselors should be a thing with regular classes.

3. Instead of construction industry, we need a destruction industry. Abandoned houses and factories need to be torn down and converted to green space. As do the buildings in non-metropolitan areas that are repeat victims of hurricanes, river floods, wildfires, etc. Eminent domain needs to be used to buy those properties up and convert them to national parks.

4. Resale shops and repair shops need to replace the stores currently in malls. Instead of stores full of clothes, a counter with fabric swatches and designs on a computer that you can virtually try on. Furniture stores that sell used furniture that's been rehabbed. Stores full of used decorative shit. (As the boomers die, there's going to be mountains of it.)

Anticonsumption,"That chart is hilarious but I think you’re a little confused. That chart has nothing to do with insects and it only applies to climate change. It seems to me that you whipped that out without thinking as an instinctive response to something that you think challenges your sacred beliefs. Plant based protein alternatives have a plethora of negative environmental impacts that your cute little chart doesn’t cover. 

It wrecks soil and contaminates water. Commercial bean cultivation requires the use of well drained soil and heavy industrial nitrogen fertilizers and soil acidifiers. These have serious impacts from their use as well as their production. Because of the well drained soil these contaminants are deposited in amounts that lead to further problems. 

I’m currently living in an area where the ground water is contaminated by similar agricultural practices.  And in the town nearby the production of such fertilizers exists. There is a fertilizer plant that primarily supports American soybean farming. When I played in the sandbox at my grandmas house the wet sand stunk of the plant even though the fertilizer plant is far outside the town. Just imagine what that does to rivers and groundwater. The solid waste from the plant is a literal mountain dumped on tribal land. I’m sure it’s much worse outside the US in poorer countries that solely rely on agriculture and have poorer practices and regulations.

Insects can be made of 10 times more protein than soy beans in dry weight. And they, as well as their feed crops, can be cultivated by using a fraction of the space that soy requires. Now keep this in mind because:

It takes about 216 gallons of water to produce a single pound of raw soybeans. 300 gallons if it gets processed further into tofu. I’m assuming it takes a lot more water to intensively process it to derive the protein from soy that’s used as an additive in a lot of the western diet. A pound of crickets takes approximately 240 gallons (which accounts for the feed crop and the little processing). In terms of nutrition (especially protein) insects requires approximately 9 times less water to produce the same amount of protein. And they don’t require fertilizers that pollute water and land that is completely unrelated to their production. 

I’ll keep it short regarding the hormones. Partly because it’s not really that big of a deal. Obviously phytoestrogens aren’t the same as a normal estrogen. They typically have positive effects for people. But sustaining a developing infant and young children on an increasingly rich phytoestrogen diet has effects that we have have a hard time measuring and disproving or proving. Even the source you use says that the conclusion was limited by available data. 

Soy’s full effects on the human body is uncertain. There’s so much we still don’t understand about it’s complex nature.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/soy/

Though the decreasing age of maturity in girls (especially in more estrogen related developmental areas) is a trend that seems to be related to increased soy consumption. At least in the American population.

Anticonsumption,"Can you tell me what cooperative incubators are? Also, how is this majorly different from now (sans high capital tax or limits)? We can't really force people to invest their savings if they really want to spend it. Then you get the people willing to invest getting a return. And who determines what risk/payoff people will get? And what they will invest in?
Think of it kind of like a credit union or bond market. A group of people want to start a co-op. Instead of getting shareholders to own a stake in their enterprise, they borrow capital from investors. The difference here is that the bond-holder has no interest in the cooperative, beyond ensuring the bond will be repaid. Once repaid, the cooperative belongs entirely to the workers, and the bond-holder is owed nothing more.

Also, a minimum wage is generally used to provide people with a livable wage. When you get UBI or negative marginal taxes, minimum wage requirements should not be necessary anymore. I'm not really sure how decreases workweeks would work, but I'm in favour of those, or regulations about minimal compensation for overtime, be it vacation days or monetary payments.
The point of minimum wage in this case is to minimize exploitation. Person A makes $20/hr, Person B makes $7. If person A doesn't want to do something they'll just offload it to person B and pocket the difference. Wages put a price on someone's time and therefore life, so it's really like saying this person's life is worth at least X.
Minimum workweeks due to increased productivity. Since the 1970s american worker productivity has doubled due to technological advancements, while pay and hours haven't changed. If instead of letting shareholders scoop up these gains we just cut hours in half over that timeframe, we can keep the same material 'quality of life', with half the work, and enjoy more of our lives. Increasing material 'QoL' is just another way of saying mindless consumerism.

For illegal acticity, definitely, but unethical or damaging behaviour is too much in the eye of the beholder for me. It is sometimes really hard to know for sure what you are doing is ethical or damaging, especially when you don't have all info.
For unethical and damaging behaviour we're talking lawsuits. Things like suing oil companies for climate change, or tobacco companies for cancer. Maybe not illegal, but definitely harmful.

Why do you want to eliminate patents, but keep copyrights? I think both should be shortened to 10 years, and they can be challenged by others in court if not in active use. They should not be eliminated imo, as they give a nice incentive for innovation. Same goes for trade secrets.
Copyrights protect products, patents protect ideas. A copyright means that nobody can steal the design files and copy Intel's chip design. A patent means that nobody else can make a chip that will work with x86 code at all (AMD is only allowed to because IA-64 flopped, and AMD64 didn't, meaning Intel had to cross-license). And a trade secret means nobody else knows how to make a silicon chip and has to develop every process from the ground up, every time. Copyrights let entities sell designs. Patents give entities a monopoly over entire markets. And trade secrets mean that nobody can learn form the work of others, stalling technological progress.

I'm personally more in favour of the negative progressive tax on the lower end, as ubi gives a disincentive to work.
If anything wouldn't negative taxes be a bigger disincentive as you lose those benefits if you do work? And once you go up to a certain tax bracket, the UBI tax and UBI credit cancel each other out anyways.

I personally like the presidency, just with less powers and proportional representation.
Proportional representation, so like another senate? The presidents' powers aren't necessary anyways. Passing/Vetoing laws is something citizens should do IMO, not just one person. The president is in no way qualified to lead the military, and actual diplomats are better at brokering agreements with other nations. Department heads shouldn't be appointed, neither should judges.

If these are national elections, i don't think people will be able to even distinguish between 100 different people tbh. Best case scenario, people choose someone from their state that they align politically with, and you pretty much get what we have now. I would keep that part the same.
Not really, because if you live in a conservative state, and the state senators are both republicans, but you're a liberal or socialist, you have zero representation. This way basically any ideology with more than 1% popular support is represented. In practice, you'd probably have a few politicians like AOC and Sanders getting most of the left vote. And some popular republicans getting the republican vote, and other parties like the libertarian party would get like 5% of the vote. Whereas now, the senate skews heavily towards conservatism (due to there being more states with a majority of red voters, despite there being more blue voters overall). It's effectively gerrymandering on a national scale. And third-party voters like socialists and libertarians are almost completely unrepresented.
I could maybe see the point for splitting it among parties, where each party is allocated seats proportionally, and the candidates with the most votes overall (IRV) get those seats, but each representative is weighted the same. Thereby preventing a few voices from dominating the conversation. But then you run the risk of party interference.

For me the house should be chosen by PR of the whole nation, two years after the president is chosen. I'd rather dissolve the senate than the house.
Honestly just a naming choice. Not important.

I'd rather have the judiciary not chosen, but consisting of professionals electing themselves. I want them to not be influenced by a popularity contest. Citizens should be able to remove a judge by supermajority for gross abuses of power.
How would professionals elect themselves? That sounds like appointment which is undemocratic. If justices need 80%+ of the popular vote to be sworn in, they need to appeal to the left and the right. Granted they could lie, favor one side, and never be removed because at least one side will keep them in. Maybe it should be easier to remove them to compensate?

The EU is now trying to get together even more. I prefer the system of the US for the EU in some respects, but right now it would not work. For the US, I'd leave it as is.
The reason I say EU is so that they can leave peacefully if the federal government gets too corrupt. Like now, for instance.

I indeed think our policies do align a lot! :) If your system has an owning class really depends on the way you see investment by workers work: if there is a difference between payoffs in projects and investment by people, there will always be differences. Same if there are wage differences between people, which I see happening in that system.
The point isn't to make sure everyone gets exactly the same thing. Like I said, I don't think that works in practice. Different careers benefit society in varying amounts, and have different risks. An underwater welder or surgeon shouldn't make the same money as a retail clerk. People who go above and beyond deserve compensation for their effort.
And if you want people to invest money, you need to provide an incentive. People who save and risk their earned income for projects that benefit the common good deserve compensation too.
The alternative to this is centralized planning, which can't possibly account for everything, and leads to inefficiency and potentially corruption.
But the other end of the spectrum, where billionaires own everything, aren't held accountable for anything, labor is devalued, nature is destroyed, and lives are ruined is also terrible.
Some people will have more than others, some will give more than others. But nobody will be able to own entire industries. There will be no billionaires. But hopefully also no homeless or starving people either. It's a balance between the three elements of production: land, labor and capital. Natural resources aren't plundered or wasted, but they can still be used if truly necessary.  Labor isn't exploited, nor is there a disincentive for effort. Investment is not discouraged, but it can't own everything.

The most important changes I think are:
- Ensure resources are valued correctly (LVT)
- Prohibit excessive wealth, absolutely no billionaires!
- Establish actually representative democracy
- Abolish corporate limited liability
- Eliminate unnecessary homelessness, starvation and exploitation
The exact structures are far less important to me than restoring the balance away from capital and back to land and labor.",1569484142,tell cooperative incubators also majorly different sans high

Anticonsumption,"I'm gonna split it up into an economic thread and a political thread to keep it managable ;)

&gt; Think of it kind of like a credit union or bond market. A group of people want to start a co-op. Instead of getting shareholders to own a stake in their enterprise, they borrow capital from investors. The difference here is that the bond-holder has no interest in the cooperative, beyond ensuring the bond will be repaid. Once repaid, the cooperative belongs entirely to the workers, and the bond-holder is owed nothing more.

Ah, I see what you mean. So only loans, no shares (at least for capital lenders). I like it! So the enterprise is not owned by anyone, not even the workers, it is its own entity after the the loans are paid of. What happens when the enterprise can't repay their loan? I assume the enterprise is entirely dissolved and it's assets are put up for sale to recoup costs, with no chance of getting out of bankruptcy right? I'm not sure if it is really different from private ownership in terms of outcomes. You can still get corporations with boards that primarily focus on profit to increase their own wages, even without ownership. 

&gt; The point of minimum wage in this case is to minimize exploitation. Person A makes $20/hr, Person B makes $7. If person A doesn't want to do something they'll just offload it to person B and pocket the difference. Wages put a price on someone's time and therefore life, so it's really like saying this person's life is worth at least X. Minimum workweeks due to increased productivity. Since the 1970s american worker productivity has doubled due to technological advancements, while pay and hours haven't changed. If instead of letting shareholders scoop up these gains we just cut hours in half over that timeframe, we can keep the same material 'quality of life', with half the work, and enjoy more of our lives. Increasing material 'QoL' is just another way of saying mindless consumerism.

Hm, I think UBI with progressive tax has the implicit effect of the minimum wage. With sufficiently low taxes (or negative ones) at the lower end, people will be able to choose their own working hours, so I imagine requiring a shorter work week is then not necessary anymore.

&gt; For unethical and damaging behaviour we're talking lawsuits. Things like suing oil companies for climate change, or tobacco companies for cancer. Maybe not illegal, but definitely harmful.

I'm not sure if we can hold everyone that votes accountable for those decisions, just because not everyone knows all the info. If there is indeed a problem of for example witholding information to the public like oil companies did, that is an illegal activity no? Maybe we're again arguing semantics here then.

&gt;A copyright means that nobody can steal the design files and copy Intel's chip design. A patent means that nobody else can make a chip that will work with x86 code at all (AMD is only allowed to because IA-64 flopped, and AMD64 didn't, meaning Intel had to cross-license).

Patents give entities a monopoly over entire markets. And trade secrets mean that nobody can learn form the work of others, stalling technological progress.

Ah I see, but then there should be some maximum price on copyrights right? Otherwise you can still get a de facto monopoly. Trade secrets I'm not sure about, due to other countries having less problems with stealing other peoples ideas, and it gets harder to protect IP without them. Otherwise, with you on it.

&gt; If anything wouldn't negative taxes be a bigger disincentive as you lose those benefits if you do work? And once you go up to a certain tax bracket, the UBI tax and UBI credit cancel each other out anyways.

Yeah, I kinda mixed these things up. A base salary (UBI) with progressive tax rates does exactly what I want. The rate of the curve is then dependent on the effect salary has on the prospensity to work. But the UBI should be really barebones to get people to work, more like a voucher system for barebones or state housing, healthcare and living necessities.

&gt;  Investment is not discouraged, but it can't own everything.
(i'll only quote that for readability) Yeah so basically we're just capping and slowing down wealth accumulation and abolishing private ownership of corporations. I'm still no enitirely sure how the ownership of corporate assets will work out, but I guess private persons cannot use them or loan them out?

&gt; The exact structures are far less important to me than restoring the balance away from capital and back to land and labor.
Same, but I like discussing on how these things can be achieved and getting into detail. It is more interesting than people just saying that for example communism or libertarianism will just magically solve the problems because they don't have some drawbacks from current US capitalism.

I think we're pretty much on the same page. And I see now how this would not be strictly capitalism due to the ownership thing. I'm kinda ambivalent to the ownership part, and with the policies outlines I think most can be achieved in a strictly capitalist system.

Obviously climate change is irreversible, because it is already happening. Even for those who (somehow) don't believe humans are causing it, changes in climate, regardless of their cause, are clearly occuring since we a literally living through it.

What the article seems to actually be saying is that a study has found evidence to suggest that reduction of future carbon emissions will do little to prevent sea levels from rising to a more destructive point than other studies have concluded.

The way I see it:

1. It's just another study. They could be wrong.
2. It doesn't mean we should give up. There will still be additional consequences from future carbon emissions.
3. It's probably useful data to someone, but not the general public. What you can do to help prevent oceans from rising X inches is the same as what you can do to prevent it from rising X+Y inches. 🤷‍♂️

Anticonsumption,"I hold dual Bachelors degrees in environmental studies and Philosophy as well as a minor in Applied ethics. I have worked in the sustainability field for 5 years across various sectors.

 On the topic of ethics and pursuit of happiness, two things to consider: 
FIRST, research “moral proximity”. It dictates pretty much every action, thought, and decision we take but no one recognizes this. In short, moral proximity is this: the extent to which an individual or group cares/gives attention/thought/effort/financial support to another is dictated by two pillars, space and time. some say there are three or four pillars, here is my quickest summary of space and time: geographic distance between the parties(you care about that which is closer to you geographically, the child killed on the other side of the world has less impact on you than the child killed next door), temporal distance between the parties (think time, if something happened 100 years ago you care less about it than something that happened 1 hour ago). The other pillars sometimes referenced include  psychological distance and political/philosophical distance, but these I consider to be subsets of geography which dictates ones beliefs. You could sum those three up under social distance, or maybe more adequate would be “economic class distance”.

SECOND: Emmanuel Kant in the groundwork of metaphysics of morals (this guy literally wrote THE book on morality and reasoning) shows that the active pursuit of happiness actively makes one less happier; I want a nicer house, so I must get more money, to get more money I must work harder and longer, because I work harder and longer I have less time for myself/family/friends and am under more stress. He has another concept called the categorical imperative which is worth mentioning.


Moral proximity is the limiting factor which prevents us from creating a unified global effort to combat climate change, injustices, you name it. This is a fundamentals argument I am putting forth. Yes there are other factors, but they are all determined by the way humans reason, how they think. Moral proximity defines how we think and act towards others. If I were to tackle the anti consumption argument, I would be remiss if I did not touch on the philosophical underpinnings of the argument which are intertwined with politics. Anti consumption is often associated with a societal paradigm shift from one political ideology to another. Currently the US is having its political system subverted by “bad” agents. I say bad here because as a philosopher I recognize the fact that there are many competing ideas of what good and bad are.

We are in late stage capitalism which means we have reached the point where we are sucking up the last’s bits of natural resources which fuel the capitalist ecosystem.  There is much debate in the philosophy community about what the next political philosophy regime to take center stage is. Many question whether capitalism is compatible with environmentalism.

By buying locally, you cut back on fast food, frozen food products, grocery store meats, and instead have to get your meat from the butchers, along with everyone else. Limiting the meat supply means people are limited to the meat they want to eat. Are you seriously trying to argue you still need more proof for sustainability, it's as simple as thinking logically, the meat and dairy industry's use of chemicals depletes the ozone, their mass nature creates unnecessary bi products, and like I said before, we throw out most of the food that kills our environment to be made, being 1/3. http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/
I am not trying to say switching to a all plant diet wouldn't be better for the environment, hell, going vegan is the best option for that being meat and dairy are basically the same industry. I'm saying, we aren't going to get the general public to switch to fast, so compromising by finding attequate substitutes to the current production of meat, whether that be through brands like Impossible or Beyond, or whether it be buy limited locally to satisfy.

No, it doesn't, although you're right to notice that that is a problem to address when working with negative emissions technology. One potential solution is to use renewable energy to sequester carbon. Another is to calculate how much carbon is produced from burning the fuel to sequester the carbon, then make sure the net amount of carbon released is negative. 

The biggest problem with negative emissions right now is that it is anti-productive from a capitalist/consumer mindset and therefore expensive. We burned fossil fuels initially to create some product which made someone money. The carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere  from this process is now warming our planet to a point where it may become uninhabitable. Every single major climate change emissions reduction plan proposed by the IPCC or whoever in the last 30 years assumes we will find some way to remove carbon dioxide from the air in addition to renewables/burning less fuel/etc. We have to find a way to take this stuff out of the air. If taking this stuff out of the ground and putting it into the air made money though, it's not too surprising that taking it out of the air and putting it back in the ground costs money instead. There's no product to sell by doing that unless you count the continued privilege of living in an environment that can support human life in that category.

That said, you may have a point that it'd be worth the effort.  Even from a strictly environmental standpoint, we use $1 of plastic now to replace stuff we used to get from say whales, or animal hooves.  It's definitely not something to be taken lightly.

But being able to rapidly break down microplastics from the ocean is objectively a huge concern, because it's a major stressor causing ocean life to fail and enforcing climate change and pushing human-caused extinctions possibly eventually including our own.

It may save us from climate change. It would also cost many, many lives. Consider how useful petrochemical-derived plastics are in the medical field.

Anticonsumption,"I’m on a plant based diet for ethical and environmental reasons myself so obviously have nothing against veganism. But veganism isn’t the panacea to environmental issues like anthropogenic climate change or biodiversity loss. These issues have an array of complex and interconnected causes so to believe that making everyone vegan would fix them is a fallacy.

Veganism isn’t always the lowest impact option nor is it always an accessible option for people in the Global South. As I’m sure you know, there are plenty of vegan diets heavy on imported, out of season foods, grown in mono-cultures, for example, almost every alternative to dairy spread has palm oil in it and regardless of the companies’ claims to be from a “sustainable” source, they are still complicit in devastating deforestation (usually via slash and burn techniques) and the displacement and ultimate loss of various native species. Or how about rice paddy fields which are a major contributor to global warming due to their emissions of methane (a greenhouse gas 25x more potent than CO2 ). The list goes on... 
 It also can be problematic for people with existing health issues. 

Furthermore, simply being vegan doesn’t address other environmentally damaging activities that someone may engage in. For example, I know of many high-profile and “ordinary” vegans who fly on exotic holidays regularly, have 2+ kids and love consuming fast fashion. None of those things are mitigated by the fact they’re vegan, particularly if their vegan diet is a high-impact one with extensive ecological footprints.

Edit: also I totally agree that the problem is the unsustainable system of consumption we exist in - that is a major issue which must be addressed. However, while the system remains intact and the “norm”, as it is now, not having children and contributing another consumer to an Earth which has finite resources and an expanding global population is an action worth taking.

GDP is up, and suicides and life expectancy are going down! I believe Yang has messages that resonate with all of us, but right now people either don't know him or think his UBI platform is a joke (it's not)

Yang proposes we begin tracking and widely reporting on measurements such as the following:

* Median Income and Standard of Living
* Levels of engagement with Work and Labor Participation Rate
* Health-adjusted life expectancy
* Childhood Success Rates
* Infant mortality
* Surveys of National Well-being
* Average Physical Fitness and Mental Health
* Quality of Infrastructure
* Proportion of Elderly in Quality Care
* Human Capital Development and Access to Education
* Marriage Rates and Success
* Deaths of Despair / Despair Index / Substance Abuse
* National Optimism / Mindset of Abundance
* Community Integrity and Social Capital
* Environmental Quality
* Global Temperature Variance and Sea Levels
* Re-acclimation of Incarcerated Individuals and Rates of Criminality
* Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy
* Design and Aesthetics
* Information Integrity / Journalism
* Dynamism and Mobility
* Social and Economic Equity
* Public Safety
* Civic Engagement
* Cybersecurity
* Economic Competitiveness and Growth
* Responsiveness and Evolution of Government
* Efficient Use of Resources

He is proposing a total shift in government incentives and wants to track our country's success on that huge list of things, nearly none of which are related to capitalism.

We are the richest economy in the history of the world. Yang has a vision for how we all prosper.

I don't think welfare programs work for the most part. I think there are too many restrictions or requirements and people get bogged down in bureaucracy.

""Those scenarios"" is a pretty vague reference. You can complain about climate change all you want. By all means, let;s do things about it. I'm willing to wager that my carbon footprint is a lot smaller than yours. But it's foolish to remain willfully blind to the costs of our proposals.

I think you'll find LOTS of people obsess over the price they pay for change. The United States still mints pennies and has 68% public support for that, for Christ's sake. Do a little sociology experiment. Find these people and ask them what harm there is in not minting pennies anymore. Prepare to be amazed to how overly fixated people can be on the most mundane (or outlandish) downsides of change while being perfectly complacent about problems that already exist because, after all, that's just life in the real world.

&gt;""Those scenarios"" is a pretty vague reference.

CO2 emissions contributing to air pollution is a vague reference. Pedestrian-designated areas are but a vague corollary with pedestrian traffic deaths. But ethanol-based fuels contributing to fire fighters having their faces melted off is, what, a direct consequence?

[Such people make up the majority of the US population.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/23779/penny-worth-saving-say-americans.aspx) (My 68% number was based on an activist group for keeping the penny, so that was an irresponsible number to cite, but the point remains.)

&gt; I don't spend my time chasing upvotes.

Not the point of what I was saying, but we've reached that part of the conversation where we just piecemeal quote sentences out of context and give snarky responses to them, which is why this is my last post.

&gt; I brought the point up simply to illustrate that people tend to look at what they want (in this case, what they perceive as a greener fuel) without asking about the negatives.

Let's be real: you brought it up to show that you're a first-responder and share some cool, lesser known facts that were tangentially related to the conversation. It's not a bad point, by the way. Those are cool facts, and if you were to get your stories published in a magazine, feel free to link me to it.

They are not, however, high leverage considerations when proposing ways to address air pollution, pedestrian deaths, and climate change. Bring them up if that's your way your expertise can contribute to the conversation, but shrugging off those concerns unless they were mentionably large statistical outcomes is the *reasonable* (not wrong-headed) response. Again, the unfortunate reality of larger society is closer to the opposite: people are far too open to hearing excuses to not implement a change and far too complacent about the extant problems of the world.

&gt; This is actually an excellent illustration of what I was talking abut; you openly insist that this single point is THE point, that that's all that matters, that nothing else should be considered. You have focused in on your single thought, and all other discussion can take a hike.

That's actually not how this conversation happened, though. I engaged with you on this point at great length. I heard you out: it will take an extra minute for ambulances to get through these areas. Most people heard you out and engaged with you on the point.

Most have simply concluded that it is a reasonable and worthwhile compromise to have a safe (the only thing more important than having better emergency response is having no emergency response, right?) and usable space for residents.

You've framed it as people being so eager about any and all change that they accept it willy-nilly without considering the downsides (which is just a plainly ridiculous summation of how humans handle issues like climate change, pollution, and city planning).

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Such people make up the majority of the US population. (My 68% number was based on an activist group for keeping the penny, so that was an irresponsible number to cite, but the point remains.)

55% ""say the penny is useful"". And they're right; it is. But a poll asking quickly and in passing one way or the other about the penny is a different thing than even a short conversation about the nature of the issue.

&gt;Not the point of what I was saying, but we've reached that part of the conversation where we just piecemeal quote sentences out of context and give snarky responses to them, which is why this is my last post.

Okay.

&gt;Let's be real: you brought it up to show that you're a first-responder and share some cool, lesser known facts that were tangentially related to the conversation. It's not a bad point, by the way. Those are cool facts, and if you were to get your stories published in a magazine, feel free to link me to it.

No, I brought it up for the reason I stated. Call me a liar as you wish.

&gt;They are not, however, high leverage considerations when proposing ways to address air pollution, pedestrian deaths, and climate change. Bring them up if that's your way your expertise can contribute to the conversation, but shrugging off those concerns unless they were mentionably large statistical outcomes is the reasonable (not wrong-headed) response. Again, the unfortunate reality of larger society is closer to the opposite: people are far too open to hearing excuses to not implement a change and far too complacent about the extant problems of the world.

I do not shrug off these other concerns, and never have.

&gt;That's actually not how this conversation happened, though. I engaged with you on this point at great length. I heard you out: it will take an extra minute for ambulances to get through these areas. Most people heard you out and engaged with you on the point.

&gt;Most have simply concluded that it is a reasonable and worthwhile compromise to have a safe (the only thing more important than having better emergency response is having no emergency response, right?) and usable space for residents.

Yes, most concluced that. Far before the conversation took place at all, actually.

&gt;You've framed it as people being so eager about any and all change that they accept it willy-nilly without considering the downsides (which is just a plainly ridiculous summation of how humans handle issues like climate change, pollution, and city planning). I'd say it's more the difference between people who see things like climate change as serious issues worth making sacrifices for and people who think we should do ""something"" but are easily dissuaded from proposed changes in the face of any negative whatsoever.

Anticonsumption,"The title of this article is a bit misleading. Yes climate change activists are protesting Black Friday bc it’s the symbol of overconsumption that is a newer concept in Europe. However the root of the issue is that sales are regulated by the government in France by law to two periods a year. The issue with Black Friday not being regulated is the false impression that consumers have access to some better deal outside of the official sales.

Anticonsumption,"Point 1) Doesn’t change the fact the modern science has created an agriculture system that creates a global surplus of food, and yet 9+ million people die from starvation a year. 850+ million are currently starving. That’s over 10% of the global population. Meanwhile in the USA and other first world countries, we throw away between 40% - 50% of our food. Why throw it away? Giving it to the hungry wouldn’t be profitable.

Point 2) Wars between major powers have not ended, merely changed. Russia and America are fighting a never ending war in the Middle East. Using the militaries there as proxies, meanwhile corporations are making billions off of contracts. America is destabilizing countless countries it wishes to exploit. Oil in Iran and Venezuela. Lithium in Bolivia. Under the guise of democracy and freedom while they undermine elected officials. Meanwhile we ignore real protests happening globally against fascist and capitalist oppressors as they militarize the police force. France, Chile, Honduras, Haiti, Bolivia, Brazil. War has not ended.

Anticonsumption,"Look, I’m sorry that I came off as hostile in my initial comment. I’m not saying that you are, but I do want to point out that we are currently in a situation where those advances in science and medicine could be for naught, considering the severity Of anthropogenically induced climate change, and in tandem, the fact that we are running out of resources to power modern day society. How do we keep up and maintain this “progress” if we run out of the very fuel that makes such progress possible? Additionally, it’s worth pointing out that a lot of the developments in modern medicine were to combat diseases that were largely missing in pre-industrial/ag societies, such as cancer, respiratory disease, CVD, CHD, etc. And we still don’t have a complete cure to most of these diseases aka cancer for instance. Even medicines designed to combat infectious &amp; bacterial disease, which were present in these pre-industrial societies, are quickly becoming ineffective (antibiotics). The CFR recently did an article on this. I’m not trying to criticize, however, I am trying to say that maybe we should all be a bit more questioning of the narrative of perpetual progress and the notion that, in general, science and technology have been a net benefit to the majority of humanity, but not only to humanity, but the earth and it’s diverse array of ecosystems which are all interrelated and dependent on each other for the continuation and flourishing of life. Given where we as a species currently find ourselves, I would have to say that maybe it has not been a net benefit, and that maybe there is a lot that we can learn from the indigenous communities of the world, who maintain a better relationship with the natural world ecosystem, and who do not necessarily need to be progressing all the time. Additionally, as I’ve pointed out above, we are in a situation which begs the question - was it worth it? And more so - can we even call it progress? What is progress? Are we really progressing as much as we would like to believe? I would argue not - there is still a lot about the nature of reality that we do not know about, and our very process of finding out this nature, aka the scientific process, could very well be inherently flawed.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;The ozone hole has shrunk and stabilised - is that not a conclusive solution?

So long as that's your only metric, sure, it's conclusive. I simply think that a principled consumer base could have solved the problem more quickly, more efficiently, and for a lot less money.

&gt;I'll add another example - legislative restrictions on agricultural DDT use that allowed birds of prey populations to recover in the US.

And I'll ask the same question; if people simply stopped buying DDT-containing products, do you think producers would stop making them more or less quickly as compared with the legislative solution we used?

&gt;And yes, of course, it'd be wonderful if the entire population consisted of rational, well-informed, economically independent people who made ethical choices at every point of monetary exchange. But that's not what we have, so I prefer to work through other channels alongside encouraging individual action.

Fantastic. By all means, work through other channels as well. But the legislative channel just cripples the concept of individual action. Overly restrictive laws just encourage people to abdicate their responsibility. Someone living under a nanny state rarely grows up. Heck, look at this sub. Nearly everyone here acknowledges that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans. And yet so, so many people refuse to take any personal responsibility for it. It's THEM, the evil corporations/CEOs/politicians/etc.

&gt;And no, I don't believe that aggregated individual action would be faster than legislative action, in that instance or any similar one. Whenever there has been backlash from scientists or the public, companies have lied and obfuscated about the risks, thereby preventing many people from making rational decisions.

So your objection isn;t so much that rational decisions made by people would indeed be faster than legislative ones, but that they are simply prevented from making those rational decisions in the first place. Correct?

&gt;You believe in the undiluted, unquestioned supremacy of individual rights, whereas I prefer to balance the various individual and collective rights and privileges. Those are both value judgments and neither is objectively right or wrong. But I believe that the evidence shows that my way gets the best results.

I strongly disagree. Take the FDA, for example; a slap in the face to individual rights if ever there was one. And they have, in aggregate, cost many thousands of lives by unnecessarily delaying the approval of lifesaving drugs, many of which are already approved in other developed countries. We're literally talking about bureaucrats saying ""No, despite ample evidence that this drug could save your life, as it has saved so many others, we're going to stop you from doing what you want with your own body and of your own free will as you attempt to save your own life"".

Anticonsumption,"&gt; I agree with the assertion that it's the consumers thinking incorrectly. There's a reason fossil fuel companies drill for oil, refine it, and sell it; because customers buy it. 

That's inaccurate. They do so, because economies have designed to be oil-dependent. There was no vote held about that and consumer choices play a marginal role. Previous generations accepted the added benefits, but they also were never given the full picture. It's similar to cases like with lead paint or asbestos, only that there is a continuing effort to downlplay the role of fossil fuels and create counter-narratives surrounding the global warming topic. The industry even kept information away from the consumers to prevent them from making other choices early on, and then drove the economies into higher dependence every year. That's the huge problem. 

And Millennials have been born into this world, they never made an active choice and now that they are becoming active consumers, they are voicing their dissatisfaction. The thing is, you can clearly not drive change through consumer choices alone, when all the products out there are directly or indirectly connected to fossil fuels.

Anticonsumption,"1. Yup, increase, that is what I said. That is what capital accumulation means. 

2. Workers do not have to sell their labor...is that so? Do you not have to work for a living? How do you eat? Are people not forced to work to survive? Does that need for survive not force people into low wage job and poverty and all of the associated illnesses that come from that poverty? No one chooses to be poor. No one chooses to be the one who has to flip burgers for a living. But someone has to in a capitalist system. Because under capitalism there is the capitalist and there is the capitalist's worker(s). That unequal dynamic sets up the demand for exploitation, and there will always be someone who has to be exploited for capitalists to accumulate capital. Read the work of economic geographer David Harvey. He talks about ""accumulation by dispossession,"" a phenomenon wherein accumulation of capital cannot occur without that ammassed capital to have come from somewhere--from someone. In order to accummulate, dispossession from elsewhere must occur. And we are seeing this with the climate crisis quite directly. The more that fossil fuels are continuously consumed and produced by the same top 100 wealthiest companies who are emitting 75% of the carbon emissions, the more climate change will dispossess people of their lives, homes and resources via increased natural disasters, famine, and drought. With the environmental crisis, too--the more chemicals and technologies industries are allowed to use in the name of capital accumulation, the more that accumulation will occur at the expense of nature and the public health, dispossessing ecosystems and humans of their lives. Endless growth always means endless suffering elsewhere.

3.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;1. Yup, increase, that is what I said. That is what capital accumulation means. 

You said various things. Including ""cannot stop"", which is not the same as ""must always increase"". Capitalism does not demand the continuous increase of consumption.

&gt;2. Workers do not have to sell their labor...is that so? Do you not have to work for a living? How do you eat? Are people not forced to work to survive?

You don't have to sell your labor. You can work for yourself, for example. And yes, generally,you have to work to survive. That's called ""life"". If humans, collectively, don't work, we will die. Regardless of the economic system in place.

&gt;Does that need for survive not force people into low wage job and poverty and all of the associated illnesses that come from that poverty?

No.

&gt;No one chooses to be poor. No one chooses to be the one who has to flip burgers for a living. But someone has to in a capitalist system. Because under capitalism there is the capitalist and there is the capitalist's worker(s). That unequal dynamic sets up the demand for exploitation, and there will always be someone who has to be exploited for capitalists to accumulate capital.

Endless growth always means endless suffering elsewhere.

And, again, capitalism does need t demand endless growth, any more than it forces people to sell their labor. I know that that's a tempting thing to claim, because it helps justify your hate, but it's simply not true.

&gt;3. People cannot just decide to ""functionally use"" communism and socialism, because those systems would require the state to own (more of) the means of production rather than capitalists, who currently own the majority of the means of production.

No, it wouldn't. Look at the twin oaks community. Living proof that people can functionally let be as communists under capitalism. For all intents and purposes, the state is nothing more than the collective will and representation of the people. That can be established by private agreement quote effectively.

&gt;There is no way to make a better funded welfare or regulatory state appear out of thin air, because ""you can functionally use any economic system you want."" Sure you could move elsewhere but also, no you can't?

Well, take your pick.

&gt;Not if you don't have the resources or speak the language, and if your life/friends/family are at home...also, this is not to say socialism or communism are perfect alternatives to capitalism.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Under what economic system have most environmentally friendly technologies been developed?

The only reason environmentally friendly tech is popping up under capitalism isn't because of capitalism, but because the climate crisis popped up at the time of capitalisms dominance.

&gt; Perhaps you think that people should return to a much simpler way of life; well, capitalism won't stop you. Go right ahead. Want to advocate for others to do likewise? Great. I certainly do, in some ways.

The problem is, EVERYONE needs to stop consuming like we do. This can't be left to individual choice, our shared planet is dying.

&gt; Capitalism in no way demands ""winners and losers"".

You're right, it doesn't demand it at all - it's just a natural biproduct of how the game is played. There is not an example of capitalism ever attempted that did not produce losers and winners.

&gt; LIFE requires consumption. People will always be consumers, so long as we are alive, under any and all economic systems.

Of course, I need to eat. But I don't need to eat a tomato in February or have meat three meals a day. But this sub is against the consumer *culture*. That I have to buy. That I have to consume. That it's a choice. But this choice is dangerous - and touted as a good thing.

Maybe. Or maybe capitalism drives innovation by rewarding people for their efforts. How much green tech development do you see in communist countries right now?

&gt;The problem is, EVERYONE needs to stop consuming like we do. This can't be left to individual choice, our shared planet is dying.

I agree, that choice is dangerous. Many choices that people are free to make are dangerous.

&gt; The consumption of animal-sourced food products by humans is one of the most powerful negative forces affecting the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biological diversity. Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides.

The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;However, there are some things commonly available in the first world - cheap cars, cheap meat, disposable consumerist junk - that are not good and need to be fixed

I totally 100 percent agree with you. But bringing the population down doesn't hurt anything either, it's beneficial to the environment. 

&gt;it's important to point out that ""overpopulation"" as a scapegoat so people living in the first world don't have to change their lifestyle.

Yes it can be used as a scapegoat for people who consume too much and are materialistic. But it is also just a fact that overpopulation is a real problem, as I said before, especially if we want all 7.5 billion people to live above poverty. 

&gt;Firstly, if we ""just stop having children""

If you're going to quote me, quote me correctly, I said ""stop having AS MANY children."" Totally different things. 

&gt;we are going to have a period where a very under-equipped youth are going to have to take care of a massive number of elderly people. I bring this up first because it's not a hypothetical, it's Japan's reality right now.

I 100 percent agree with you there, but that's the price we have to pay for our fuck up of almost tripling our population in 50 years. Also if we don't slow population growth then the world will have much bigger problems to deal with than the elderly. Climate change is already killing hundreds of thousands of people each year. It's projected to kill 250 thousand every year starting in 2030.

&gt;Secondly, you say ""education will help"" as if it's a simple answer, but it's not.

Never said it was simple, but it 100 percent is the most effective way, especially educating women in poor countries, to give people better lives and have less children. It is a proven statistic that the more educated a woman is, and the longer she goes to school/college, the less children she will have. Look it up for yourself if you don't believe me.

&gt;If you're willing to argue that we need to educate people about not having children and the use of prophylactics, why not educate people about not eating meat, or not driving cars, or a host of other environmental ideas that would be literally just as controversial as saying ""no more children""? 

That is what I mean by education. An entire 16 year education about anything and everything the world has to offer. That would be part of the plan, education on the environment and how we can help it, which includes public transportation, plant based lifestyle, living smaller, less consumption.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Please remember what you said initially: ""Overpopulation is the the reason why everything else is a problem"". Now you're shifting to ""well, it wouldn't hurt"".

Yeah because you were arguing against anything to do with lowering the population, which is stupid. I can tell you don't understand the problem to the fullest, so I was trying a different angle on it for you. Also if you think overpopulation is not a problem, then you have no problem with the projected population of 9 to 12 billion people in this century if we continue on the path that we are on? That is what I am truly talking about when I talk about overpopulation. That's why I say we need to start having less kids NOW. The best time to have started is 50 years ago, the second best time is now. If you truly think our projected population path is fine, then I'm done discussing this with you because you obviously don't even have common sense. 

&gt;You effectively did

I still never did. All I'm saying is general and higher education is the solution to climate change, which includes population.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Also if you think overpopulation is not a problem, then you have no problem with the projected population of 9 to 12 billion people in this century if we continue on the path that we are on?

Again, Malthusianism is completely disreputable in this day and age. When used properly, technological advancement makes up for increasing population. The problem is not that we CAN'T accommodate this many people, it's that capitalism doesn't care about sustainability. You're blindly shouting ""too many people"" without an actual understanding of the problem, and then your solution (""educate people so they have less children"") is just as difficult as the other things that would actually solve the problem.

&gt;All I'm saying is general and higher education is the solution to climate change, which includes population.

At this point in the conversation I think it's really hypocritical for *you* to expect *other people* to get more educated when your own education seems to have failed you so thoroughly.

Let me put it this way. Americans make up 5% of the world's population but consume 24% of its resources. In essence, each American citizen consumes 5x what an ""average"" world citizen does. Do Americans lack education? Of course not. America is a first-world country. Yet we are also the epicenter of the world's consumption-related problems.

Your solution is that education in the third world will reduce birth rates. However, even with their current birth rates, the third world uses less resources than Americans do. It takes FIVE third-world citizens to equal ONE American.

You justify your statements by saying that *in a perfect world* those third-worlders would use more resources. But rather than making things more efficient, and reducing consumption in the first world, you focus entirely on reducing population. That is to say, we need to reduce the third-world population because ""in a perfect world"" the third world would have more resources, which would be bad for ecological reasons. So it's a two-step process: first we have to give the third world more resources, and second we need to restrict those resources and get them to have less children. Do you not see how you're putting the cart before the horse here? Do you not see how saying ""we should just have less people (specifically brown people)"" comes off as tone-deaf and insanely racist? And yet you insist on it because of your convoluted multi-layer argument which exists solely so you won't just say ""yeah okay it's the first world's fault"".

For example, that system will have companies that strive to be net-zero impact in their resource consumption from energy to water, that are limited in what plastics they can use to create products and will be responsible for the waste their products create, that governments will work together to close the loop of a circular economy to follow the 3 Rs, that will democratize company leadership and decision making so that profits benefit front line workers and shrink CEO pay gaps.... etc etc etc.

Anticonsumption,"My motivation for living with less stuff came from cleaning out my grandparents' house after their death.  There was 90 years worth of stuff in the house and 5 barns (the property was not cleaned out after my great grandparents passed).  After all the work I did with it, I was determined not to leave my sister's kids (I don't have or want kids) to do that with my estate.  

But if a friend of mine wants to live like they're on an episode of Hoarders, I'm also not going to tell them to go minimalist.  

THere's also a difference in HOW you promote beneficial behavior.  A vegan handing out pamphlets or yelling at someone for eating a burger is not going to help their cause.  But posting a delicious (ideally naturally) vegan recipe on an unrelated sub (I'm not vegan but there are several vegan recipes I really like) or on Facebook might cause a person (family) to add (another) vegan meal into their rotation.  I know that I've shared a vegan lentils and rice recipe to Frugal and Poverty Finance.  

Dave Ramsey is a Bible thumping southern hillbilly Republican.  He consistently tells people to eat ""beans and rice rice and beans.""  In his example, he wants people to eat low-cost beans and rice and to put the money they would have spent on meat towards debt.  I highly doubt that he gives a shit about animal rights (and I'd bet money that he enjoys a good steak or BBQ pork sandwich).  He belongs to a political party that doesn't believe in climate change.  (Even though I'm a northern agnostic Democrat, I listen to him because he helped me get out of debt in my 20s and get my finances on track.)  

Will sharing that recipe make someone 100% purist vegan?  Will Dave Ramsey's beans and rice make someone vegan?  Probably not.  But ultimately someone adding more vegan meals into their rotation  is a lot better than 1 more vegan purist.

Here we calculate final energy footprints; that is, the  energy embodied in goods and services across income classes in 86  countries, both highly industrialized and developing. We analyse the  energy intensity of goods and services used by different income groups,  as well as their income elasticity of demand. We find that inequality in  the distribution of energy footprints varies across different goods and  services. Energy-intensive goods tend to be more elastic, leading to  higher energy footprints of high-income individuals. Our results  consequently expose large inequality in international energy footprints:  the consumption share of the bottom half of the population is less than  20% of final energy footprints, which in turn is less than what the top  5% consume.

Anticonsumption,"While this is definitely better than nothing, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) did leave something to be desired on the actual sustainability front. A lot of points toward awarding LEED levels account for things like having parking spaces and a bike locker, extra fresh air inside and more day lighting. These items use *more* energy and resources rather than less. If it is truly going to be a carbon neutral building (and if you have any say or know anyone with any say, or if you're just curious) you should looks at the Living Futures project called the living building challenge. It demands that every single resource used to create a building be accounted for on the other end with a full environmental pay back plan. Good stuff.

I don't mean to shit on LEED too much, I'm a LEED Designer and really do think it is better than nothing, but the mechanical systems (which account for ~60% of all commercial building energy use) can still be crap and get a gold cert. Mechanical system improvement is *very* expensive and they don't want to scare people of from tending toward good things by making it cost prohibitive, so it makes sense, but it's very frustrating. While on the topic, commercial buildings make up about 40% of our energy consumption in the first world, meaning mechanical systems in office buildings and schools account for about a quarter of all energy use. Remember that next time someone tries to tell you that China and India are the problem when it comes to climate change, or shipping is the problem or bad industrial practices or whatever.

Anticonsumption,"Thanks for your detailed response. I will check out those studies and look forward to building a more informed opinion. I have the Cowspiracy film from a friend already - I haven't watched it yet, though. I'm not a fan of the extremely emotive language used in these films, which is the same sort of language that now saturates the political discourse on both sides. The reason I don't like it is because it's very divisive, bringing us back to that 'us-vs-them' mentality that I think doesn't help anyone. I find the news nowadays incredibly depressing as well, not just because of its content but because of how incredibly obvious the divide-and-conquer tactics are. Keep the people occupied with small things while we fuck em. And it's working beautifully...all around the world. 

I mentioned the Arctic because I do a lot of work up there and have spent a fair bit of time in such small communities. It may feel very outlandish and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, but believe me when I say that for those people there it is very important indeed. And they really don't understand why they're being vilified for living the subsistence lifestyle that they have for millennia. These are places where anything else simply isn't an option. 

That brings me to another point why I don't think 'complete' veganism will ever be for me. On my moral compass, if I have to choose between an item made from leather and one made from a plastic imitate...I'm not going to bring more plastic into the world. Similarly, for me the tradeoff between meat that's locally grown and plant-based food that's flown halfway across the world on cargo planes and container ships - again, the lines very much blur. I don't the emissions calculations every time I go to the shop, but that, rather than ethics, is what guides my behaviour as a consumer. (Where I live, you don't get that wide a range of local fruit/veg...)

There's a philosophical point here, as well - it could be argued that we are better than killing animals, it seems that we elevate ourselves on a pedestal, i.e. humans are better and morally superior than animals. This pedestal is something I have a problem with. I feel like this is a bit of a technicality, and certainly not a serious argument against veganism, but it's perhaps an interesting point to ponder. 

You concede that there are differences between a hunt - where animals technically have a chance of getting away - and industrial farming, where they are bred for one purpose. I'm not sure I'm completely on board with this, because even if the animal has a chance to escape/defend itself - the hunter's and the farmer's intentions are surely the same: to kill the animal. In fact, the question could be asked whether a life in the wild - which for animals other than humans in the western world is a near-constant tooth-and-nail fight for survival - is preferable to a shorter life in which food is abundant and predation is not a daily worry. I'm not saying that either is better or worse and I know that farming practices are often horrifying, but these are some of the moral points as to why I think that the ethical case for veganism is more grey than completely black-and-white. 

And that's where my earlier point comes from about engaging with people. I work in adult education and often deal with things that some people do not like hearing about, in my case particularly climate change. It's another debate that's very easy to paint as a black and white 'you're with us or you're against us' image, but the reality is far more complex than that. 

It doesn't help that in both the climate and the veganism debates (related as they are), governments and hugely powerful lobbies are often opposed to our goals. That's what we're up against, and that's why I think it often feels like such an uphill battle. 

I was going to mention the discussion I saw you had with another person on this thread, as well. It was actually the one I initially commented on, with the person whose father I believe might have died recently(?) and had been a cattle farmer and that's where they were coming from. I hope you don't mind me saying that I don't think that discussion went very well, in that nobody really gained anything from it. I'm sure you didn't change their mind, and if anything their stance towards vegans may have become more negative during that interaction. The thread pretty quickly comes to you telling someone that their father murdered animals for fun and money. If I may say, that doesn't strike me as a great way to get someone on your side - whether you think it's true or not. Wouldn't your potential for success have been greater by not attacking the person's father but instead showing how in the present and future changes have to be made? My analogy is talking to people about the continued and growing use of fossil fuels. There's no point telling an old person how everything they've done so far is wrong - for the longest part of their lives nobody really knew any better. I've had more success with trying to get people on the team for the future by offering firstly evidence that everyone is needed to fix this, and ways in which it can be done. 

And I would argue that giving people a choice of either ""you either kill and torture animals or you don’t, there isn’t any ‘cutting’ down"" (your quote) isn't helpful in most cases. Again, people don't go from full carnivore to full vegan from one day to the next. I wonder if it would be more productive to try and get people to try what it's like to cut down on your meat consumption from 5x to 2x a week, or whatever number fits. If you get 1 million people and 90% of them do that (and perhaps notice the positive lifestyle changes and educate themselves further), you've done a lot more animals a favour than by telling those million people that unless they go vegan immediately they're awful people. I don't think many would be swayed by that to change their behaviour at all. (Note how I'm using an argument here that I'm not in full agreement with - the animal welfare one - because I know that it's something you feel deeply about. Hope you see where I'm coming from.)

The reason I say all this is because I think it's so, so important to get these messages out there, and I see so many instances of it just failing to happen because both sides just start insulting each other and any content there may have been is drowned out. It sucks that the onus is on the 'good guys' to provide evidence and 'tempt' people away from mindless consumption and destruction, but that's the way things are thanks to mass media; I don't see that changing anytime soon. 

I really hope that this doesn't come across as condescending, because that's not what I'm aiming for. I hope you don't take offense that I critiqued some of your other posts on this thread and offered suggestions. I see us very much on the same side of a struggle (even though you may disagree given my stance on leather etc.), and I wish you every success in future discussions around the topic, and getting more people on board.

I'm empathetic to the part of them that isn't an owner, which is frequently a fairly small fraction.

Their exploitation is a bad thing. They're doing a bad thing. How much empathy do you want me to have for someone solely described by a bad thing?

I still want them to have human rights, I still want them to have good lives, but I don't want them to continue the brutal exploitation of others.

&gt; With the technological entrepreneur that built your phone?

See the propaganda? No entrepreneur built my phone. My phone was delivered by laborers that boxed, shipped, and carried it to me. My phone was assembled by people working in a factory. The components with which it was assembled were put together by machines. The machines are run by workers. The materials needed to create those components were either mined directly or were processed at factories by workers. Some of those materials were likely mined by slave children. Most of the software was contributed by volunteers and the underlying tech developed by scientists paid through government grants.

The tech ""entrepreneur"" wielded capital and a business plan for making money off of these things.

&gt; You see, not everyone earned a fortune to keep dad's business...

I don't know what that means.

&gt; Maybe love is not compatible with capitalism, but I am sure making people more aware of the situation the political and economic systems are in, would do better good than restructuring the whole economy in this point.

The pain and death experienced by others at the hands of this system is unimaginable. It is not enough to sit by and watch the horror, capitalism must be replaced. Capitalism is currently fueling our death march into uncontrolled global warming because it doesn't care about consequences 50 years down the road, it cares about the amount of money that can be made *right now* by burning fossil fuels and eating cows. Billions will suffer and die because of this system and way of thinking.

&gt; Idk, I'm just rambling now, I admit to not have thought about it this way, so I'm still processing.

Rambling is fine don't worry about it.

&gt; My original post was slightly offensive, because I was simply wanting to call for attention the people that choose economic as a feature to hate...

It's good to hate things that cause incredible pain and horror. They should not be tolerated, they should be fought against.

Capitalism isn't going to go down without a fight. It can, will, and has sacrificed millions and millions and millions of people to sustain itself, because the owner class has class solidarity: they'll fight for themselves to your denigration every time.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;The reason I don't like it is because it's very divisive, bringing us back to that 'us-vs-them' mentality that I think doesn't help anyone. 

I don’t think that mentality is apparent in the film, it basically is about a man asking large environmental charities why they aren’t doing more to promote the detriment of animal agriculture. it’s more of an argument why isn’t there more education available as appose to meat eaters vs vegans

&gt;they really don't understand why they're being vilified for living the subsistence lifestyle that they have for millennia. These are places where anything else simply isn't an option.

I mentioned this in my last comment but I’ll reiterate, I’m focusing on promoting veganism in a western society where it is so easy to go vegan and not touch any animal products, obviously if people could go vegan in this conditions I would advocate for it but most of the time, people come up with so many excuses why they can’t in every day scenarios, if you look up the definition of veganism you will see that unusual cases are covered in that

&gt;That brings me to another point why I don't think 'complete' veganism will ever be for me. On my moral compass, if I have to choose between an item made from leather and one made from a plastic imitate...I'm not going to bring more plastic into the world.

I think if you chose to purchase an animals dead body over plastic then your moral compass is unfortunately slightly off, you do know you could not participate in buying both? An animal shouldn’t have to die for you to have it’s skin. What is your opinion on wearing fur??

&gt; Similarly, for me the tradeoff between meat that's locally grown and plant-based food that's flown halfway across the world on cargo planes and container ships - again, the lines very much blur.

Did you know that all transport combined (cars, planes, trains and shipping) all equate to less Co2 emissions then animal agriculture? Also that is from a purely environmental stand point, if you take into account the ethical implications and health repercussions of eating an animal based diet, then the plant based option regardless of where it came from is always better

&gt;There's a philosophical point here, as well - it could be argued that we are better than killing animals, it seems that we elevate ourselves on a pedestal, i.e. humans are better and morally superior than animals.

Yeah ofcourse we are, we have moral agency so we can make them right and wrong decisions. I think if you put every human in a room with a pig and a knife majority of people wouldn’t do it but when we pick it up in the supermarket we are essential paying hitmen to do our dirty work

&gt;i'm not sure I'm completely on board with this, because even if the animal has a chance to escape/defend itself - the hunter's and the farmer's intentions are surely the same: to kill the animal.

Yeah that is why I used the word technically, I find them both morally abhorrent

&gt;Which for animals other than humans in the western world is a near-constant tooth-and-nail fight for survival - is preferable to a shorter life in which food is abundant and predation is not a daily worry.

I’m going to have to hard disagree on this one, there is no way you can possible think that a life inside a factory farm can be any worse than life in the wild? If so I don’t think you know the extent in what we do to these animals, watch the first section on pigs in this documentary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko&amp;t=4340s) and tell me that is better than living in the wild. You say this is a grey area but can liberation and freedom ever be the similar to guaranteed death?

&gt;It doesn't help that in both the climate and the veganism debates (related as they are), governments and hugely powerful lobbies are often opposed to our goals. That's what we're up against, and that's why I think it often feels like such an uphill battle

They are against it because they provide subsides to animal agriculture and powerful lobbies are often paid by the animal agricultural industry to promote there products( See cowspiracy).There is such big money involved they often try to play down climate change and animal ethics because it is too detrimental to their pockets.

&gt;I was going to mention the discussion I saw you had with another person on this thread, as well. It was actually the one I initially commented on, with the person whose father I believe might have died recently(?) and had been a cattle farmer and that's where they were coming from. I hope you don't mind me saying that I don't think that discussion went very well

Yeah ofcourse I don’t mind you saying that, I’m rational and can take criticism. I do agree with you, the conversation didn’t go too well, I think I was probably over aggressive but that was mainly because of blatant lying on their behalf, he genuinely tried to tell me that his father could only exclusively do animal farming because of his PTSD, he also tried to state that he did it for enjoyment and he didn’t profit off it

Yeah I probably didn’t change his mind but I don’t have to be nice to him, people are continually trying to play the victim in this but in reality it’s only the animals who feel the knife in their throat. Again, if he felt upset by it, he can walk away from the screen. It’s not an obligation to reply to Reddit comments.

I’ve explained my method of advocacy and the brutal approach probably has more success than you think, that person has probably had nice vegans discuss it with him and he still ultimately has the wrong perception of veganism

&gt;And I would argue that giving people a choice of either ""you either kill and torture animals or you don’t, there isn’t any ‘cutting’ down"" (your quote) isn't helpful in most cases. Again, people don't go from full carnivore to full vegan from one day to the next.

Sadly this will never be the case, in anything that humans do abhorrent (Rape,kill,steal, exploit, abuse others) we would never allow these actions to happen on a gradual basis. If I went up to Martin Luther King and asked if I could only cut down my racism from doing it 5 times a week to only 2 times a week, he would probably tell me to fuck off.

It’s such an injustice to these animals to even take that position. Also from a vegan advocacy stand point, imagine if I advocated for this 2x a week approach, it would completely undermine everything that has got us up to this point. Like what kind of message would I be sending out, it would make veganism look frail and misguided, I hope you can see that from this standpoint.

Everybody who thinks overconsumption (and related issues as climate change) is just a problem of capitalism, should read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea#Irrigation_canals) section of the Wikipedia about the Aral Sea's history (or read about the environmental/pollution standards in West and East Germany by 1989).

It's a problem of priorities, both collective and individual priorities. If we get those priorities right, we can solve the problem within capitalism too. Climate change is a good example: if we priced in the cost of emissions, I'm pretty sure we would fare very well with capitalism. Across industries,  the corporate world would have a hard financial interest in avoiding emissions a and therefore devote many resources and talent to it. The smartest heads of corporate world, highly specialized people in their niche would probably tap onto potentials far beyond what a centralized planned economy can achieve.",1588273934,gt last posts seen sub whining posts gt get wrong kinda related valid critiques getting hand everybody thinks overconsumption related issues problem capitalism read https section wikipedia aral sea history read standards west east germany problem priorities collective individual priorities get priorities right solve problem within capitalism example priced cost emissions pretty sure would fare well capitalism across industries corporate world would hard financial interest avoiding emissions therefore devote many resources talent smartest heads corporate world highly specialized people niche would probably tap onto potentials far beyond centralized planned economy achieve

Anticonsumption,"I can tell you are frustrated and I'm sorry if I've come off poorly. I do feel your counterargument is based off misunderstanding of everything I said, as well as a mischaracterizes me (for instance, I personally do the things I recommended above, as well as individualistic things*). 

I am explicitly asking you to do things, and I am explicitly asking you to not dilute yourself. I genuinely think making it an egoist issue does more harm than good, especially when juxtaposed to political action, which both has a much bigger impact and is historically the thing that works best for social change goes.

I certainly would not advise against personal action, but the point is that will only go so far. That's why I said it's ""largely not a personal responsibility issue"" rather than saying its not at all a personal responsibility issue. If you don't believe me, you might be interested to know that 100 companies emit 71% of emmissions. You had said that you have not seen any clear plan, but there are many plans some are much more serious than others (I will put some below). If you're interested in that you should look up project drawdown which lists out 80 technology that exists right now that could mitigate climate change. They are ranked in order of GHG reduction, but the reality is personal action is not going to do much in the way of the vast majority of them because you do not have control over your power plants not being part wind farm, how your food is farmed, how much education and Family Planning access women have in developing countries (when women have kids when they want them, they have less),  and you don't have the ability to restore large swaths of land to use as carbon sinks. Some things you might be able to do, like eating a plant rich diet, taking public transit, installing solar panels, composting, etc. However, it would be absurd to imply that everyone has access to do those things if you live in a place where a nutritious plant based diet can't be reached because if you live in a food desert or if buying solar panels with a high upfront cost it's too much for you for example.

Even if you do have the ability to effect the big ticket things like if you own large swath of land or own a power plant, we have a system that rewards you for specifically not taking actions that help everyone, and externalizes costs to everyone but you when you harm everyone. One persons individual sacrifice will not change the perverse incentive.

The fact that you haven't seen a plan is not a personal failing of yours, but is absolutely a collective problem as we have education systems that are not properly reaching whatever demographic you are. The belief that this is an egoist problem is propagated by media that blame individuals, yet refrigerant management would equal 90 GT equivalent of CO2. Does your town have a HFC collection set up? Should I let the world literally burn because most people dont know how much of a cheap and quick way to reduce massive amounts of ghg in the atmosphere? No, I write my local representative and thank them for spreading the word about or local recycling center for CFCs, and encourage them to promote it more.

The cost of not doing anything will destroy the economy and hurt the people who did the least polluting. Unfortunately its going to require time and energy to develop activism skills now to work towards a netter future. Your last point is doing exactly what I we should be doing, spreading g the word. But it needs to be paired with things that have a high impact and are work (did you know a carbon tax won the Nobel prize? Did you know last year the former UN climate chair said everyone needs to do civil disobedience to voce their governments hand?).

*I am not a keyboard warrior, I do personal stuff like all my furniture is used, eat a mostly vegan diet, research lifestyle changes that have high impact, garden, practice food waste reduction, choose eco and ethical products often, recycle, wear my clothes until I cant mend them anymore, and more. That being said, I also have called and wrote my representatives, have gone to CCL, have gone to protests, have done acts of civil disobedience. If I could pick between 10% of people not buying a nestle products and doing the things I do or 10% of people doing political action, I would pick the latter every single time without fail.

You absolutely have skills that can be useful in the climate movement. There are tons of road maps, dont believe the lie that the alternative to blaming individuals is to sit and do nothing:

Anticonsumption,"I do understand what you're saying, and I am glad you are in this fight. 

I just don't think it matters at all on an individual level,  lifestyle changes will never save us, all it does is give people the idea, ""I'm not the problem, it's all those people eating meat that are the problem."" But it isn't those people, it's those governments, and those businesses with bad business practices.  

It really boils down to us either saying **WE** are killing the planet, or, **THEY** are killing the planet. (They being corporations in this case.) I can't tell people that their individual behavior is destroying the planet. It is not true, we can not collectively impact the environment, the way certain industries can. 

The only way out of this is to empower people into fighting against the greed of industry which is killing the planet, not make individuals feel guilty about their individual carbon footprint. I mean sure, shown the coal rollers, litterers, etc. But leave the blame where it belongs. 

Take Leo DiCaprio, he travels in planes, eats meat, and has a much greater footprint than most people. He gets a lot of flack for it from the right and also from the left. But I would argue he is doing more to help change policy than most and is merely using the resources which are provided by industry. 

And like I said, when is enough enough? There is always going to be someone being more ""green"".

Anticonsumption,"Not much we can do as individuals, unfortunately. This is a decision that needs to be decided in one voice, or at least the collective voice of a majority. It would also mean that we'd have to go back to the drawing board to rethink the way we live and work, and that's not really something the massive corporations want to do because they're making a sickening amount of money. Hell, some of these companies make even more money because of the crisis and are using the mass unemployment as a way to get cheap and expendable labour to keep it all going. These people cannot refuse the job either, seeing as a lot of other businesses are closed and explicitly not hiring. So off they go into some giant corporation's despair centers to be worked into oblivion for very little money. 


I don't know how we would even get out of this situation,  really. Consumers and producers are symbiotic and it's a relationship that has always been a cornerstone of societies everywhere.

Judging by this statistic it’s likely we go extinct before we even cross the threshold of 1% of the time dinosaurs were around. And that’s depending on how you categorize a “dinosaur,” crocodiles for example have lived perfectly fine since there were other dinosaurs around, until now when we’re pushing them to extinction. 

&gt;we can become the specie that lives a very long time compared to others thanks to intergalactic control. 

You are just so delusional...we’re not even at 1% of the total time dinosaurs survived and we’re already causing one of the most drastic climate change and extinction events in the history of the Earth.

&gt;It's good to have a good critical look at ourselves sometimes. That's what this is doing, dream bigger, demand more and so on.

It's not a critical look, it's empty complaining. ""Being critical"" implies not only criticism but also suggestions for improvement. This article has lots of the former but none of the latter.

&gt; I couldn't agree more, what's the difference really? 

You're being ridiculous if you think capitalist democracy and feudalism are basically the same. Even Marx said that capitalism was an improvement over feudalism and was a necessary step on the way to socialism. ""Being a wage employee is the same as being a serf or a slave"" is a fucking disgusting and ahistorical take.

&gt;They criticised a particular moment in history of state socialism not the idea as a whole 

The author literally says that the mistake made by the CNT-FAI was ""\[leaving\] the state intact"". You're being an idiot. And at no point does the author advocate for nationalization or state industry or anything that would actively suggest they are a state socialist, leaving me to infer that you're a state socialist who's trying to line up your own philosophy with this article despite all evidence to the contrary.

&gt; Maybe by 2050 we'll have a bearable wage, but... we might not have a planet to live on. You sound like your parents, realistic criticism, alternatives, this is utopian; it's called imagination and belief in humanity, we kinda forgot that 

You don't have an actual solution, you have complaints. You are not contributing a goddamn thing towards building a better world because you have no plan to improve it. All you have is whining. That's not ""imaginative"", it's pathetic. And it's not ""belief in humanity"" because you don't have any ideas for what humanity should do to improve their position. It's fucking HEINOUS to say that you don't need a plan to improve things because there are a lot of people out there - environmentalists, economists, sociologists, etc - who DO have an actual plan. So you're going to pretend like this article's mediocre criticism of the restaurant industry is NECESSARY to, what, avert climate change? Are you fucking kidding me?

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Do you all have something you're grateful for spending, that's more of an experience versus a product? 

Nah, or at least I personally don't. To me, experiences are just more consumption, because one experiences them once, then it goes away. I prefer building up assets more than experiencing things, and especially prefer it more to buying garbage that just breaks. For others it may be different, but I don't usually get that much out of seeing things IRL instead of online, especially because I don't have the most vivid memory and tend to live a lot of past things through photos and videos anyway. Again, though, maybe its different with others. 

I would suggest saving money for a potential rainier day, in case you end up losing your job someday, and especially with climate change likely to get worse. Perhaps invest in larger stocks of shelf-stable supplies, like food, that you would have bought anyway, so if you lose food money, you have extra, and if the food supply chains go, you also have extra. Maybe slowly build up an off-grid electricity setup, so you don't have to pay electricity and so that you will have enough whether you lose employment and can't pay for it or if the grid goes down. Save to own your own living space, whether building on cheap land you buy, or buying one of those ridiculously overpriced houses. 

There's a lot of vulnerability in the current civilisation (see /r/collapse, which is definitely biased, but has decent content on the subject), and there should really be less vulnerability. If more people save, less people need to be saved if and when things go wrong (even for mundane disasters like unemployment). Off-grid solar setups also have the additional advantage of not contributing as much to the problem in the first place, as opposed to burning fossil fuel for electricity.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; Human nature is the most plausible cause for consumerism.

For most of existence humans didn't engage in consumerism at all.

If we look at the big history of humans only a very small itsy bitsy percentage has ever engaged in mass consumption.

There is a lot more to humanity than our own culture and different cultures will view consumption differently. If your view of humanity is limited to only the greedy cultures then of course it looks greedy. Humanity existed for hundreds of thousands of years before agriculture. Why does that not count as human nature?

&gt;Private ownership and market-determined prices are not the cause of evil

Good and evil are too simple though. Those are just relative concepts. Growth based economics encourage humanity to take up more of the biosphere of the planet than they would have before. At a certain point if any species occupies too much of the biosphere it will collapse. That's not evil or good, it's just what happens in a system when it loses complexity.

&gt; if the government owned companies instead (which is the case in a non-capitalist world)

It's not about just 'ownership' but who is allowed to be considered stakeholders in these companies actions. The problem with private ownership would exist even if our bloated incompetent governments ran them. Too few running too much for too many. I very much think our economic and political systems need work.

We need to consider not just owners, heck not just the workers in these companies too but the planet itself as a whole. Private ownership limits the repercussions to the owners pocket book essentially. Morality and ethics are then just footnotes of consideration and can be fixed with money via PR firms.

The more things that are given ownership status the more people that have to be considered stakeholders. Which means the more people that influence the operations of that company.

Climate change is being caused by this unchecked growth and consumption. It's being driven by a type of prisoners dilemma where individual owners are at a Nash equilibrium. None of them can improve their position more by changing it but unless they change their positions we are all going to cook.

To remove that equilibrium we need to change the elements of the situation that support it occurring. Which is breaking up the stalemate of private owners competing to expand their individual companies into something that serves the larger biosphere.

Anticonsumption,"I totally understand where you are coming from, trust me I get it. Sometimes I just want to shout at them ""why don't you get?!"", and often I find myself collectively judging a whole generation in anger. However, I don't think that is a very productive thing to do. Calling a whole generation ignorant is not going to help anyone as it doesn't really make you feel better for saying it (if anything just more frustrated), and it doesn't make it more likely for boomers to listen to anything younger generations say.

 I'm from a generation that is often collectively referred to as one that doesn't care about anything and doesn't want to put in any work or effort (generation Y, in case you were wondering). I know that that's simply not true, as many of my friends and I care greatly about many things and put in all we've got. But if I reject that stereotype about my generation, I have no business doing the same thing to boomers. So once I look past my frustrated collectivising view, I see many, many people - many individuals - from the generation of the baby boomers that do care a great amount about environmental issues and are trying their best.

I think it's hard for us younger people to get their resentment towards change, after all it's scientifically proven the right thing to do. For us, the Cold War and the battle between socialism and capitalism is long in the past. For baby boomers, that was their reality, that's what they grew up in and I would guess it felt just as threatening as climate change does for us younger generations today. That means that the sense of security that a capitalist system provides is something they deem worth fighting for. Taking what many people still understand to be ""normal"" and ""necessary"" away can feel very threatening, especially because it is that generation's symbol of freedom and security. 

Change is hard, that doesn't mean it isn't necessary. I'm not typing this whole essay out because I want to apologise that kind if behaviour, and I'm not here pretending it doesn't annoy or frustrate me either. I just think understanding each other and showing compassion is the first step of working together, and working together is the first step of change.

You also can't force people to eat less. What would you do? Limit the intake of food per household? Issue food on a meal-by-meal basis so people don't use up their quotas at the beginning of each month/week/whatever? Do I even need to explain how disgustingly authoritarian that is?

uhh this has nothing to do with this post. I agree that there is a lot of exploitation in manufacturing, especially in the developing world, but this store has literally no hand in that. We don't even know where they're getting their masks from.

Blaming the store, or stores in general, is a bit ridiculous. People need masks, and the store provides them with them. If you were to go about changing exploitation in factories you wouldn't do it through shutting down stores, you would do it through changing policy to make exploitative practices illegal.

But the thing about climate change is that it occurs on a scale; it's not a binary where either it happens or it doesn't. So anything that we do helps.

Anticonsumption,"This is a false dichotomy. You don't need to use leather *or* plastic based wools. This comparison also focuses only on what happens after disposal and not the impact of production, which for most products is by far the most impactful part of a product's lifecycle.

The irony of statements like this are frustrating.

If we want to accomplish something we need to swing for the fences. You can't accomplish a goal if in your heart you doubt it's even possible.

Target fixation is not just a physical sight concept but a mental concept. You wind up creating the kind of world you believe exists.

So if you want to see generations working together to stop climate change but your reaction is ""that is impossible because I am cynical"" you then become part of the problem. Regardless of whether you agree it should happen.

By voicing your opinion that it is not possible you do your little part in stopping it from happening. It echos that you should not put effort into making this change since it is futile. It is futile only as long as people believe it is.

Believing in nothing and being skeptical of absolutely everything isn't a superior logical position. Just because something is unlikely doesn't mean it's impossible and if the unlikely thing is social change then it's not nearly as unlikely as it seems. Merely adopting an attitude of thinking it's possible will make it far more likely to happen.

Anticonsumption,"The image of Bezos made him look very old and rich, which isn't the typical stereotype I think of from tech entrapeneurs. This inspired me to look him up on Wikipedia, to see how old he really is (he was born on 1964-01-12) and maybe see what he looked like when he started Amazon. This lead me to the following section: 

&gt;In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore. He left his job at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle. Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet. **He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon**.

Wow! That's not exactly self-made, is it? I mean, okay, *technically* he is self-made because he has become *far* richer than he started out, as the richest person in the world, but still, that's a *huge* head-start! It seems he was already pretty rich far before he became as rich as he is today… 

Having money really does lead to making more money, it seems. 

Now, on to the article itself. 

&gt;""The key conclusion from our review is that we cannot rely on technology alone to solve existential environmental problems – like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution – but that we also have to change our affluent lifestyles and reduce overconsumption, in combination with structural change,"" Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales Engineering told that college's newspaper regarding the study.

Precisely how much consumption is overconsumption, in this case? Am I overconsuming? If so, how far along am I to not overconsuming? 

…

&gt;""Considering that the lifestyles of wealthy citizens are characterised by an abundance of choice, convenience and comfort, we argue that the determinant and driver we have referred to in previous sections as consumption, is more aptly labelled as affluence,"" the authors point out. 

I do love choice, convenience, and comfort. How much must be sacrificed for the planet? 

&gt;They advocate reducing avoiding or reducing consumption ""until the remaining consumption level falls within planetary boundaries, while fulfilling human needs,"" with the wealthy abstain from purchasing overly large homes and secondary residences, large vehicles, excessive quantities of food, and engaging in leisure activities that require a great deal of flying and driving. 

Oh, is this *not* talking about the group I'm in or the things I care about? I was thinking it might be talking more about physical goods, not things which are *that* expensive, and was thinking it might be talking about *my* group as I am in a first world country, but maybe it's not?? 

&gt;The authors also argue for consumption patterns ""to be shifted away from resource and carbon-intensive goods and services, e.g. mobility from cars and airplanes to public buses and trains, biking or walking, heating from oil heating to heat pumps, nutrition — where possible — from animal to seasonal plant-based products."" In addition, they call for ""the adoption of less affluent, simpler and sufficiency-oriented lifestyles to address overconsumption — consuming better but less."" 

Oh; I'm already doing pretty much all of this. I guess my food isn't that *seasonal* though; that might be something to look into. 

&gt;This approach would need to include ""addressing socially unsustainable underconsumption in impoverished communities in both less affluent and affluent countries, where enough and better is needed to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth and guarantee a minimum level of prosperity to overcome poverty.""

Maybe I fall more into the less affluent group here, at least partially. Although I am slowly getting better things that need to be replaced less (or which even should last a lifetime), I am still in an apartment without a local source of renewable energy, and still do not have my own food source.

Also, better working conditions for slaughterhouse workers (if a less industrialized agriculture would still have them). While we just had a massive outbreak in a slaughterhouse, I think a better example for disease would be multiresistant bacteria due to high antibiotic use in industrial farming, the Covid19 pandemic was mainly because of globalization. But again this (the antibiotic use) could be solved by less industrialized farming.

*Edit: Except you're talking about, how this whole mess started by some people eating bat soup cooked under questinoable hygienic conditions. Then you're right. However, then we could still argue that not eating the bat soup was the problem, but the hygienic condition under wich it was prepared.*

&gt; The concept and name of the carbon footprint derive from the ecological footprint concept,[20] which was developed by William E. Rees and Mathis Wackernagel in the 1990s. While carbon footprints are usually reported in tons of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per year, ecological footprints are usually reported in comparison to what the planet can renew. This assesses the number of ""earths"" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint. The carbon part was popularized by a large campaign of BP in 2005.[20] Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they measure merely emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.

Most vegans probably have a more accurate perspective than many people who still eat meat.

Animal ag is horrendously polluting, unsustainable, and terrible for the environment.  The oceans are being over-fished, methane and CO2 from cow/pig operations are contributing to global warming, massive deforestation is being done in Brazil to grow soy to feed to ever increasing herds of cattle, etc... the list goes on and on.

Anticonsumption,"True, but this is a bad argument to make for a few reasons: (a) the Soviet Union did not have the understanding of climate change that we have today; (b) it can easily be argued that those countries were run under state-capitalism anyways; and (c) that those states were either helping to fight wars or were rebuilding/developing.

I do agree with you that over-consumption and deregulation is indeed to blame, but I figured I'd add my two cents to develop this discussion a little more.

Anticonsumption,"It is true irresponsible production and consumption are the causes of climate change, and that that model of production can be run under both systems. However, overproduction and overconsumption are inherently rewarded under capitalism and in some instances become the lifeblood of the economic model. This sometimes is also the case under socialist modes of production, however (and this is kind of important) environmentally conscious production and consumption can be incorporated into socialism in a way that will never take place under capitalism. Note that this does not mean that socialism is inherently green or that it is impossible to pollute under it, just that the model allows for that amount of flexibility that is, was, and will never be the case under capitalism.

And it kind of makes sense. If the workers are in control of the mode of production, and see the disasters that will come and will directly affect them, they are incentivized to change. Capitalists will feel the effects far later and at a far reduced rate, their economic interests are geared towards the accumulation of wealth, and the measures they should take are often not the most cost-efficient and offer little to no return on investment so they contradict their interests. They will exploit and extract until it becomes too expensive to do so, and then move on to the next well to dry up until there is nothing left. This phenomenon is a direct result of the mode of production under capitalism in a way that it is not under socialism.",1599473820,true irresponsible production consumption causes model production run systems however overproduction overconsumption inherently rewarded capitalism instances become lifeblood economic model sometimes also case socialist modes production however kind important environmentally conscious production consumption incorporated socialism way never take place capitalism note mean socialism inherently green impossible pollute model allows amount flexibility never case capitalism kind makes sense workers control mode production see disasters come directly affect incentivized capitalists feel effects far later far reduced rate economic interests geared towards accumulation wealth measures take often offer little return investment contradict interests exploit extract becomes expensive move next well dry nothing left phenomenon direct result mode production capitalism way socialism

Anticonsumption,"That logic operates on the false pretense that the increase in wildfires are from entirely local factors instead of global warming that is also causing an increase in hurricanes for Louisiana, Houston, Florida, etc.

When it comes to fighting ecological damage, both parties a severely lacking. One doesn’t do anywhere near enough and the other entirely ignores it. Both of them are wholly owned and both allowed regulatory capture of the EPA. Neither oppose fracking.

Both parties are right wing economically beholden to their hyper-capitalist overlords, with the establishment Dems only socially center left when it doesn’t hurt their corporate masters. Before Reagan, even the republicans were pro socialized healthcare (The Nixon administration socialized the care for renal failure under Medicare regardless of age, and the republicans running against FDR were also pro welfare). Nowadays I’d be surprised to see Biden or Pelosi support socializing chemotherapy or putting a cap on the price gouging on life saving medication. There are some good ones such as Lee Carter and incumbents losing to candidates who actually care about the American people.

The claim that the USA is a land of opportunity isn’t even true anymore:

**The USA ranks poorly in upward mobility, in fact it ranks near last in the developed world at 27th (among nations with less than a 1/6th of the GDP per capita), while countries with socialized medicine and socialized higher education make up the top ten. The Nordic countries take all of the top slots. Pulling yourself up from poverty is far more difficult in the USA.**

Instead we have the politically illiterate who believe the DNC is a Leftist party. That being said, at least they aren’t attempting to defund Medicare/Medicaid to the same level (nearly $1 trillion cut to Medicare and over $1 trillion to Medicaid starting in 2021). Mark Esper is looking to cut military health benefits by $2.2b as well.

Both parties are contributing to 50,000 dead per year from lack of health insurance and many more from inadequate health insurance. The USA also ranks worst among G7 nations for workers rights and last in the developed world for healthcare outcomes (37th over all nations). 60% of bankruptcies are medical **related** and 42% of cancer patients are bankrupt after 2 years. Death or destitution shouldn’t be a thing. The average cost of a hospital stay WITH insurance is $1k per day and only 39% of Americans can afford that with savings alone.

44% of American workers aged 18-64 are low wage with a median hourly pay $10.77 and yearly pay $18,000. With middle income earners ($19-$24), there is a 46% change of ended up with lower pay with a job change.

The bottom 50% hold 1% of the nations wealth (bottom 80% hold 7%), while the top 1% holds 40% (top 10% has 76%). The gap is only getting [worse](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/06/14/top-1-up-21-trillion-bottom-50-down-900-billion/) This is worse than France pre-revolution. Over 30% of the nation has a negative net worth. The top 400 families now pay a smaller percentage in tax (since 2018) than the bottom 50% of the nation while holding significantly more wealth.

If a government doesn’t look out for the well-being of the majority of its citizens, it doesn’t deserve to exist. We’ve reached a point where the super wealthy have [far more](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf) influence on policy than the people do.

Anticonsumption,"The emissions are correct.  I don't dispute those.  What you are having trouble with is what carbon neutral means.  Carbon neutral is keeping the same amount of carbon in the carbon cycle.  CO2 and CH4 have the same amount of carbon but different global warming potentials.

Not all of the carbon ingested by cattle turns into methane, if it did cattle would not be carbon based lifeforms.  The carbon cycle includes the burps (which have been occurring for millenia), rot, decomposition; the ENTIRE carbon cycle.

The only thing that has changed is humans putting carbon into the cycle that has been sequestered for hundreds of millions of years, fossil fuels.  The result of this is likely going to release carbon (in the form of methane) that has been sequestered in the artic tundra for millennia.

What is your link between land waste and calories?  If wasted calories is the argument, how many calories do humans waste through respiration?  Caloric efficiency is only important if applied to every creature in the cycle, plants - prey animals - omnivores/carnivores - insects and microbes.  I'm certain the cycle loses a lot of calories between each just by allowing the species to respirate.

Anticonsumption,"**The discussion was that eating meat is one of the worst environmental impacts you can have.**

&gt;.  What you are having trouble with is what carbon neutral means.  Carbon neutral is keeping the same amount of carbon in the carbon cycle.  CO2 and CH4 have the same amount of carbon but different global warming potentials.

It seems highly disingenous to state that ruminant animals are carbon neutral, in a post responding to the environmental impacts of meat, when you know that they're responsible for a per calorie/per g of protein [far greater](https://ourworldindata.org/carbon-footprint-food-methane) contribution to global warming than eating plants does.

&gt;Not all of the carbon ingested by cattle turns into methane

Of course not, but each cow does release 70-120kg of methane per year. That is a vast conversion of what would otherwise be aerobically biodegraded into mostly CO2, into CH4, a 20x more potent greenhouse gas. There's also a wide range of other GHG emissions caused by animal agriculture aside from the cows' respiration.

&gt;The only thing that has changed is humans putting carbon into the cycle that has been sequestered for hundreds of millions of years, fossil fuels. The result of this is likely going to release carbon (in the form of methane) that has been sequestered in the artic tundra for millennia.

That's not the only thing that has changed. [Animal agriculture does play a significant role where in natural history it did not](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-06-01-new-estimates-environmental-cost-food).

Something more specific, such as a chapter or an excerpt, would be great if possible. Just quoting the name of a book isn't ideal if it's the basis of your argument.

&gt;What is your link between land waste and calories?

Using animals to extract calories from land is highly inefficient because 90% of calories from primary producers are lost per trophic level. Ie, a cow wastes [90% of the calories it consumes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2m39j6/revision/6) through respiration, meaning more land is required to produce the calories than would've been required if just growing and consuming plants directly.  [This](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/410/cpsprodpb/9123/production/_105755173_milk_alternatives-updated-optimised-nc.png) shows land required to produce various milks (that's an Oxford university study published in *Science).*

&gt;If wasted calories is the argument, how many calories do humans waste through respiration? Caloric efficiency is only important if applied to every creature in the cycle, plants - prey animals - omnivores/carnivores - insects and microbes. I'm certain the cycle loses a lot of calories between each just by allowing the species to respirate.

We're talking about the impacts of meat, how is human calorie wastage relevant? I'm comparing the inefficiency of producing meat/dairy vs human-consumable plants directly.

&gt;Feces have been produced by animals since animals existed, what has changed is the population concentration of those animals, and thus their feces. Small organic farms would return the concentration to levels far closer to their natural levels, which also includes reducing the population to something resembling the bison population before it was obliterated.

My optimist answer: public opinion has changed massively since the 70s, back then the only people that knew about the consequences of greenhouse gasses were the ones actively trying to suppress that info so they could turn more profit. Recent polls have shown that 80% of Americans see climate change as a serious threat. If we are going to make any serious progress it absolutely has to be in a system where the people in power aren't the same ones massively benefiting from fossil fuel production. The majority of the country agrees we need change, but you'll still see Biden with the ""most progressive platform ever"" defending fracking like his life depends on it. I honestly doubt that socialism would be the magic bullet to bring about change, but I'd rather take my chances with that instead of a system where fossil fuel billionaires have such a massive influence on government and the media.

There is even CURRENTLY an outbreak of human affecting Covid (transmitted from human population, to minks, among themselves and is now, slightly genetically different, affecting humans again) among Danish minks, which it is possible will not be cured by the current vaccines we're working on because of the mutating nature of a virus.

""This means that improvements in energy-efficient design rarely compensate for the impact of production when a device is replaced with a new one, with calculations suggesting that a smartphone may be used for between 25 and 232 years before it becomes environmentally beneficial to replace!""

Anticonsumption,"That's a fair criticism, and would make the situation a *bit* less dire overall. The first article I linked to does make mention of that issue:

&gt;Secondly, the global food system is complex and geographically highly unequal: high-income countries have moved beyond the stage of aiming to meet basic nutritional requirements from food production, and now dedicate a large share of food production to meat (which is a much less efficient nitrogen converter) and bioenergy production.
&gt;
&gt;A global estimate therefore hides these inequalities; it may be the case that less than 48 percent of the population in high-income countries rely on nitrogen fertilizer to meet basic food requirements, whereas this share is higher in lower-income nations.
&gt;
&gt;Nonetheless, general estimates tend to converge on a figure in the range of 40-50 percent of the population.

With that being said; even if animal produce was banned globally, that likely wouldn't entirely cover humanities food requirements in a post-fossil fuel world, as the population will continue to increase for as long as the remaining fossil fuels hold out, and increasing global warming could [cause crop production to fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/k3200s/collapse_of_civilisation_is_the_most_likely/ge2qk8z/) due to undesirable weather, or weather disasters directly causing crop damage, (hopefully 3D indoor farming will be able to mitigate that somewhat). 

Both of those combined could leave hundreds of millions (especially in third world countries) starving.

Anticonsumption,"I agree with you that the development of the infrastructure could be  problematic to the environment and costly compared to traditional practices. Prior to reading the website u/randomchaos99 posted I was imagining vertical farming to require a parking garage/multi-story type structure with fields planted on each level. However, they appear to be warehouses. 

Warehouses have some advantages in this case. Existing warehouses could be  modified to support indoor farming. This would still required some construction, but would significantly reduce the environmental impact and cost when compared to new construction. 

Many cities have environmentally impacted parcels that remain vacant. If proper care is taken, warehouses can be constructed on these sites. For example, there are distribution centers that are constructed on landfills. The property is cheap and in most cases it results in the remediation of properties that desperately need it. Remediation is expensive, but there are many existing grants and subsidies (Brownfield) that would pay for a considerable portion of the redevelopment of the property (i.e. most of the site work). 

Warehouses are generally pre-engineered buildings that have the ability to reduce construction costs by efficiently designing the structural steel components using non-standard shapes. 

If the warehouses are located within metro areas, a likely result would be a reduction in the overall transportation of the produce to the final point of distribution. The distance between some cities and farms can be enormous. The existing transportation system also requires additional warehouses. I would imagine cold storage warehouses have similar energy demands.

In my area, cultivation facilities (marijuana) are currently the craze due to state legalization last year. It seems reasonable to believe that these facilities will find efficient methods for indoor farming/ hydroponics for the local area. If anything, they will serve as case studies for the environmental impact of warehouse vertical farming.

Energy consumption may be the limiting factor. As you point out, most areas are still reliant on fossil fuels as a primary source of electricity. Hopefully, in the years to come methods for producing energy that release less greenhouse gases are adopted, which seems to be the current trend. It is still probably not happening quickly enough. I would also assume it is a substantial increase in green house gas emission from traditional farming, but I don't know for sure because the equipment used and transportation required for traditional farming produce green house gases as well.

There are couple issues with the scale at which we currently practice traditional farming. Those being  the destruction of natural habitats due to its relatively large footprint and the draining of local aquifers to meet increasing demand ([https://youtu.be/RjsThobgq7Q](https://youtu.be/RjsThobgq7Q)). I am not informed on the yield per square-foot difference between traditional and vertical farming. However, vertical farms would likely occupy already developed properties.  Vertical farming could be more efficient in water use and could be performed in areas that have large aquifers that can support additional farming. Although large cities (depending on their location) generally have problems with depleting the local aquifers and surrounding water sources anyways (LA and LV). It will likely not be feasible everywhere.

Warehouse vertical farming could more resilient to climate change, but that is just conjecture on my part. Overall, I think the concept should be explored and implemented where it supports communities and reduces environmental impact. The answer is probably a hybrid system where both practices are used at sustainable levels. I do not agree that subsidizing the infrastructure defeats the purpose because traditional farming is already heavily subsidized.

Community gardens are beneficial, but I agree that they cannot produce enough volume. They are more useful for education and for those that enjoy organic farming. I admit most people would not want to participate at the community garden. I do enjoy volunteering at urban farms though.

We were not meant to survive into our 80s like we are today and the fact that the youth are struggling is a consequence of an unbalanced system where there are too many resources being hoarded by the elite and elderly and were told to not compete (ie: in nature we would have ransacked their homes and took their shit but we’ve been conditioned to feel shame and guilt for wanting to fight to survive when these people hoard resources.)  

Humans are not inherently bad but society as it is had been for the past 200ish years is unsustainable and we’re wiping ourselves out. It’s just not in our genetic programming to consume in moderation, and it’s not a “human” thing but due to the fact that dearth and suffering is the status quo. When you let a dog or cat decide how much it can eat it will eat itself to death. Without predators deer multiply to the point of starving themselves. Shit like the plague , famine, and the flu kept our shit in check. Human population has grown unchecked since WWII and it is inevitable that the population will collapse whether it’s self inflicted or not. 

I am pro-reproductive rights but we can’t pretend we can follow our ancestors and just have all of these kids and shit will play out exactly like it did even 20 years ago.

It's natural to seek approval from others, it might be not so to check your social medias every 10 minutes.

Plastic grocery bags and plastic straws are the equivalent of a mass extinction event, we are told, but not the tens of *billions* of plastic face masks that are being discarded every single day, many in parking lots and on sidewalks where they eventually end up in lakes, oceans and rivers. If the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is really as real and as deadly as the medical industry claims, then all this mask litter is also creating a global biohazard situation. Chinese virus remnants could be brewing in the mesh layers of all those discarded masks, putting everyone who comes in contact with them at risk of infection. ""Masks act as air filters rather than barriers,"" Dr. Joondeph explains. ""A barrier would be one of those space suits with a self-contained breathing apparatus worn by researchers in the most secure biolabs like the one at Fort Detrick."" ""If such a filter was in the ventilation system of a bioweapons lab, capturing lethal viruses, would it be tossed in the trash along with coffee cups and candy wrappers? It certainly would not, instead considered hazardous biowaste, decontaminated, and disposed of safely.""

## Those disposable, Chinese-made blue masks everyone wears take 450 years to biodegrade

Many people who wear a mask regularly are probably unaware of the fact that those disposable, made-in-China blue ones contain plastic materials that take 450 years to biodegrade. This means that for the next seven or eight generations, all those filthy masks will stew in the world's water supplies and leach microplastics well into the future. Since tens of millions of people wear these blue masks one after another, day after day – with no end in sight – there will effectively be untold *billions* of them littering the world's oceans pretty much *forever*. The environmental impact of this is virtually immeasurable. An analysis out of the U.K. determined that every single day in Great Britain alone, 66,000 tons of contaminated plastic waste is created from people wearing single-use masks. Since many retail stores are still handing out single-use blue masks like candy on Halloween, people continue to take them, use them once, then throw them in the trash or on the ground on the way out to their car. ""How many will end up in oceans and landfills, contaminating water and food chains with micro-plastics?"" Dr. Joondeph asks. ""Will sea animals become entangled in elastic mask straps as they are with plastic six-pack rings?"" Another irony is the fact that fossil fuel-derived petroleum is required to make single-use blue masks. If the leftists pushing the man-made climate change conspiracy theory achieved their ultimate goal of completely transitioning to ""renewable"" energy, there would be no more raw material available to make these masks. ""The same 'follow the science' crowd is also quite certain that man made global warming will destroy the planet, now in nine short years according to climate scientist John Kerry,"" Dr. Joondeph says. ""Yet they are ignorantly or willfully paying no attention to the real environmental impact of the mountains of trash created over dubious COVID rules and mandates, such as masking up the entire population indefinitely.""

Or simply a power grab by the left?""",1615560156,united kingdom alone mask waste exceeding https five eiffel towers worth rubbish every single year yet heard peep alarmists filthy plastic pollution destroying planet catastrophic rate brian joondeph says mask pollution serious problem completely ignored establishment plastic grocery bags plastic straws equivalent mass extinction event told tens billions plastic face masks discarded every single day many parking lots sidewalks eventually end lakes oceans rivers wuhan coronavirus really real deadly medical industry claims mask litter also creating biohazard situation chinese virus remnants could brewing mesh layers discarded masks putting everyone comes contact risk infection masks act air filters rather barriers joondeph explains barrier would one space suits breathing apparatus worn researchers secure biolabs one fort detrick filter ventilation system bioweapons lab capturing lethal viruses would tossed trash along coffee cups candy wrappers certainly would instead considered hazardous biowaste decontaminated disposed safely disposable blue masks everyone wears take years biodegrade many people wear mask regularly probably unaware fact disposable blue ones contain plastic materials take years biodegrade means next seven eight generations filthy masks stew world water supplies leach microplastics well future since tens millions people wear blue masks one another day end sight effectively untold billions littering world oceans pretty much forever environmental impact virtually immeasurable analysis determined every single day britain alone tons contaminated plastic waste created people wearing masks since many retail stores still handing blue masks candy halloween people continue take use throw trash ground way car many end oceans landfills contaminating water food chains joondeph asks sea animals become entangled elastic mask straps plastic rings another irony fact fossil petroleum required make blue masks leftists pushing conspiracy theory achieved ultimate goal completely transitioning renewable energy would raw material available make masks science crowd also quite certain man made destroy planet nine short years according scientist john kerry joondeph says yet ignorantly willfully paying attention real environmental impact mountains trash created dubious covid rules mandates masking entire population indefinitely ever environment virus simply power grab left

This is driving up rents and housing prices and destroying ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest. It also means infinite production of wastes and pollution, and we're seeing the effects of that with rapidly increasing CO2 levels causing the ice caps to melt, small island nations to be submerged, and widespread ecological damage from climate change which is risking events like the [Clathrate gun scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis) which puts the continued survival of our species into doubt.

A long ski season, for example, is antithetical to the warming trends of climate change and would therefore encourage actions to slow it. 

Given the current state of US politics there seems to (unfortunately) be benefit in partnering with organizations that have money and influence to wield. I suppose that's my limited take on it.

All these little things you do, are meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and each of them deal with somthing that is a problem, but is no where near the important issues ruining the world.

I'm not saying you can't do anything, but the only thing you can do to significantly help, is to actively campaign for governmental change and laws in favour of a much harder green alternative, and support charities and organisations who campaign themselves. But even then this doesn't help tackle that the richest 1% use double the emmisions of the poorest 50%. Global population rise has meant that since the 90s, we pumped out as many emissions as since the beginning of human civilisation. 

It's a depressing notion, but try find joy, we can get out of it if we work together, but if you're not campaigning for governmental and societal change then the sacrifices you make don't amount to much. And you certainly shouldn't feel obliged to give up somthing than brings you joy, just because it's not the best for the environment.

Anticonsumption,"I understand your point and respectfully disagree. Not because individual straws make or break the climate change, but because individual choices as a whole also influence market, politics and perception of what can be done. However, it’s good to note that as an aggregate, ALSO those individual choices do have effect; while not enough to turn the ship entirely, still course-correcting.

First, let’s remember richest countries contribute to the bulk of emissions. I know people who have cut their emissions to 1/5th of average and are living a very nice, rich life. If everyone did that, boom! We’d already bought ourselves some more time. But more importantly, they are changing what we perceive to be a good life and influencing changes in markets/politics.

To look at this feedback loop closer, we know that our emissions big controbutors are construction, food production, and transportation. Meat production is a big factor (though of course nothing is an extremely large part of the whole). In my country and many others there has ben a recent shift of moving towards meat alternatives and less meat in general - enough to support new producers, make it mainstream and speed up the change. A positive flywheel, if you will. If this is not influence, then what is? It is also not sacrifice
 by any stretch of the imagination, just moving the view of ”the normal” to a smarter direction.

However, yes, please contribute to larger scope as well. Electrification of, well, everything, stricter laws in manufacturing and construction, circular economy especially on a large scale. An example of why larger scale effort is so much more effective is the compost thing mentioned before. Composts are awesome, of course, but they will never work everywhere (think apartments) and for everyone (not everyone will bother). In my country and much of Europe, biowaste is collected separately and treated - in my area composted and sold to farmers, in some used for biogas and then to fields.

Anticonsumption,"Another dangerous thing is blaming capitalism.

Socialist countries fucked the environment too. One just needs to read up on the Aral sea or the state of the environment in West and East Germany. Fighting climate change is an issue of political priorities. Are we, as a society, willing to reduce meat consumption? To change many other aspects? That's the key issue and it's independent of our economic system. If the Soviet Union still existed, it could decide in favour of meat just as it decided in favour of trying to grow cotton in the desert. 

It's important to understand this, because otherwise we might focus on the wrong solution (especially because if we align incentives properly, imo capitalism is probably the safest bet because it means an insane amount of people working o solutions with many more different approaches).",1625379422,another dangerous thing blaming capitalism socialist countries environment one needs read aral sea state environment west east germany fighting issue political priorities society willing reduce meat consumption many aspects key issue independent economic system soviet union still existed could decide favour meat decided favour trying grow cotton desert important understand otherwise might focus wrong solution especially align incentives properly imo capitalism probably safest bet means insane amount people working solutions many different approaches
Anticonsumption,"I partly agree, and you made a whole load of good points. But I was told at high school, nearly 15 years ago now, that if we stopped all emmisions instantly, the world wouldn't stop warming for 100 years.

But since then it's been an exponential growth, during a time we are all becoming environmental. The 2% atmospheric carbon that will shift the planet down into an irreversible climate disaster, where climate change itself is now causing climate change. That 2% is already there in the atmosphere, it just hasn't percolated up from the lower atmosphere yet. Unless we actively remove carbon from the lower atmosphere even cutting our emmisions entirely and instantly this second would not help. The 2019 australian wildfires kicked out more emmisions than 100 countries combined over the same time period, and that sort of thing is going to be a common occurance every year now.

Whilst what you're saying is correct, it's the best way we can encourage a societal change, it's too little too late and far too fucking slow. 

A lot of those things you mentioned don't tackle the big route of the issue either. Cutting out meat means nothing if you're buying imported vegetables (fuck off avocados) and using a lot of palm oil products. Composting won't save the world, neither will carrying reusable bags to the store. Reducing the times you fly, that could help, in the UK 70% of international flights are taken by 15% of flyers. So again, if you only fly for a holiday once per year or so, dont worry. There really isn't much use in society moving this way if the few that really endulge, who are wealthy enough to do so, dont stop. And I really do see your point that this is the best way to change them over time, it's just too slow and we are focusing on the wrong things.

It is sacrifice, because we will make our lives harder and more expensive, which is already a big ask for some people, while other people do not change theirs and add a higher carbon footprint than I've ever done in my life within 2 years. I won't stop, because I'm passionate about it, but we all have to, litterally every single one of us.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;I think a big part of the issue is the focus on infinite economic ""growth"", which is the aim for pretty much all governments including left wing ones.

I don't even think that's a problem. The problem is defining growth without considering climate and environmental impact. Infinite growth is a good goal if you are internalising the environmental impact of growth so that you don't grow at the expense of our Planet. You want to encourage technology and businesses that are able to produce more steel with less Ressource consumption. You want new technologies that tap into unrealised potentials. You still face the challenge of offsetting these efficiency gains with more consumptions, but that can be regulated.

&gt;Capitalism is directly to blame for a lot of the current environmental issues but you do have a point.

Again, I'm sceptical about blaming capitalism for something that happened on the Soviet Union and East Germany too. I think the problem is simply to care more for production than for sustainability, which is something independent of the economic and political system. The Roman Empire and European monarchies in the 16th century already fucked up some of their  environment.

&gt;However left wing governments as a general rule are more willing to intervene in ""the market"", while much of the right wants deregulation. And pretty much all climate science denial comes from the right rather than the left.

That's a good point. I do trust some lefish parties more in matters of climate. I do not however trust far left, outright socialist parties on this matter. And I've extensively talked ith people in these movements about climate.

Because “growth” in the economy is an arbitrary measure of cash flow. Growing the economy just means more cash flow in the economy, which is a good thing, and costs nothing in and of itself. What matters is _what_ is growing.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;This is why pricing things appropriately through taxation is so important.

If those goods weren't cheap, people wouldn't buy them. If people don't buy them, the companies don't exist. So now the companies are gone, meaning you just took a roundabout solution to reach the same point: stopping production. The actual solution is public or cooperative ownership, not trying to finagle control over private companies through sector taxation.

&gt;Because “growth” in the economy is an arbitrary measure of cash flow.

The problem is that we have an economy where that ""arbitrary measure of cash flow"" determines whether a lot of working-class people survive or not, even though we have plenty of food for everyone. Again: public or common ownership fixes this problem, not putting a few restrictions on private companies.

&gt;Since we have a post industrial economy this is fine, the plurality of “growth” is people using more software, going to more local experiences, and travel… not buying useless widgets.

Building an economy on luxury items and service professions seems to be the *opposite* of ""fine"" We could easily survive as a society without people working in those jobs, but because of how capitalism works, they (a) have to exist and (b) cannot be allowed to fail because then the system collapses. We already went through this with Covid.

&gt;Cars, HVACs, and food waste solutions are the most impactful things for global warming. Those things aren’t about growth.

That was done to facilitate growth - everyone buys cars, cars are a big industry, car manufacturers generate lots of jobs.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;There’s not some grand architect deciding the nobility of different industries and assigning market share accordingly.

There's a small number of people who control the majority of wealth in the country. If you had a ""democratic country"" where 8 people's votes counted for 60% of the election results, wouldn't you say that was a problem? I mean, most people would, you probably wouldn't.

&gt;But you… think… that’s frivolous and backwards?

I mean you're the one who wants to measure importance based on its percentage of GDP contribution. You set the standard here dude, I don't know if you're even following your own logic. To answer your question, no, I don't think buying and reselling real estate, or renting out real estate, should make up *40%* of our economy.

&gt;OMG I CAN’T WASH DISHES ANYMORE I’LL HAVE TO - bag groceries? Be an Amazon meat robot? Stick flyers on people’s doors? Be a sign flipper in front of a pawn shop? Unskilled labor has options

Did you notice that these options are all terrible? You literally just reinforced my argument: the majority of the population are already doing unnecessary labor and it's going to get worse as jobs get automated away. How much worse do you think things are going to have to get?

&gt;Call me a boomer if you want, I’m in my 30s and you’re just using it as a euphemism for “not poor” anyway.

I called you a Boomer because you (a) believe the market is fair because of how you personally benefited from it and (b) dragged AOC into a conversation to get mad at a point she made that wasn't even really relevant. And also (c) you're senile. If you're only 30 that's a bad sign, dude.

&gt;I said I thought you’d enjoy Bullshit Jobs, not that he’s correct.

The extremely normal thing people do where they recommend books that they don't think are good or valid. OK. Let's just pretend that it makes sense for you to recommend books that are already clearly part of my argument, and that it's somehow a burn on me to claim I haven't read them yet?

&gt;His entire premise hinges on the notion that the vast majority of humanity are wealthy college educated professionals employed for purposes of sheer vanity. 

Maybe you should actually read the book you recommended.

&gt;He absolutely nailed human nature, and said “But I don’t think they should though.”

Veblen points out how people waste huge amounts of time and money because capitalism is a broken system that rewards the greediest among us, you *agree with his assessment*, and yet your conclusion is ""well we shouldn't do anything to fix it because that's human nature"". Genius. Really glad I spent time talking to you so I could be exposed to this amazing analysis.

&gt;We absolutely COULD be working 15 hour weeks, or even less, if we could be satisfied with a 1930 standard of living.

You *know* that's not what Keynes meant but you truly just do not care. In any case compared to the 50s and 60s, housing prices and medical prices have gone up, and electronics / luxuries have gone down (often due to overseas jobs).

Anticonsumption,"Yes, people realize that if we didn't work to make billionaires richer we would have to work to keep our communities alive and healthy. Many people find joy and purpose in that.

Most people do not get to choose what skill they hone, but are forced into some meaningless task where their labor is exploited.  Many people do not find any joy or purpose in that.

There's no where near enough space for everyone to homestead.  If you listen to economists, they'll tell you were not overpopulated, but if you listen to natural and earth scientists, there is some real concern.  Continued, unchecked human population growth (especially in the West where we consume so much) will come with dire consequences that no one is willing to acknowledge.  We've decimated insect and wildlife populations over the last 60+ years.  The Earth Overshoot date has crept earlier into the year for decades. (This year was July 29 - holy shit) We're consuming far more resources than can be replenished (for decades!) - has anyone stopped to think about what this actually means?  Peak oil has likely already passed. Our world is so dependent on fossil fuels that when the tap starts to finally slow in the coming decades, we're likely going to see some truly horrible shit - wars, famine, and such.  Water is not a renewable resource and it's likely that we'll also see wars fought over water in the future too.  And I've not even mentioned climate change or the mismanagement of resources or soil depletion...

Not wanting a job that is unnecessary and exploits you is anti-consumption.  Do not conflate this for disrespect to those that work labor intensive jobs.  Fast food is unnecessary. It's a beautiful thing to feed your fellow humans, but fast food only exists because every other job works us to the point where cooking can be a stressful task. And even then, you likely don't have the time to cook whay you actually want, so you take short cuts - prepackaged meals or components of meals.  Fast food is a way to buy back some of your time.  The same goes for disposable items.  Not working shitty jobs would give us the freedom not to have to buy our time back. 

We wouldn't have \* to consume so much if we weren't overworked and underpaid. \* And I mean ""have"" and not ""want"". We're humans, not robots. Humans have mental and physical limits. There's a reason mental illness has been rising for decades. I don't blame anyone for buying food that comes in wasteful packaging.  I blame the corporations for exploiting so many people that they were able build a ginormous factory and distribute their product nationwide, so that the only way to sell to everyone is to package it the way they do.

With all the automation we have now, we should have been able to relax some,  but instead were being worked the same hours with less pay.  Our only purpose is to make the rich richer.  And the rich get rich by exploiting people, our environment, and taking natural resources.  Not being a cog in the wheel to their schemes is anti consumption.

That's typically **not** the case with consuming animal products, which are often consumed mindlessly (see also, how shocking it is to realize how many food products include animal products) or for excessive pleasure.

That being said, this isn’t a free ticket to doing nothing. It’s an argument that requires nuance, and that you get diminishing returns after going vegan really fast for individual actions.

2. Is there utility in not flying to help prevent climate change? Probably not. Unless a different mode of transportation improves on the convenience and safety of flying, people are going to fly.

But when we consider what other means they use in order to maintain this customer base like

- Creating ads and other manipulative tactics to influence the average person (ever wonder why there's so much chocolate in the check-out aisles?)

- Advocating behind the scenes to remove what few protections and regulations they have

The companies should be taking a majority of the blame. Not for creating products, but for creating environments where these production lines and constant growth rates are expected. The governments should be protecting citizens (which yes, we do have the power to vote in).

COVID alone has proven that we're not capable of ""coming together"" to make a change.

Anticonsumption,"U think the mass worldwide movement to stop eating meat is because people want to claim moral superiority…? Ok friend. Ever consider that some people actually might just care about animals and the environment?

The one I recommended would change your perception of the animal agriculture industry’s impact on the environment.

Anticonsumption,"People love capitalism because it lets them buy stuff without seeing the negative impact.  People believe in deities without any evidence they exist.  To think people choose veganism to attain a sense of superiority is not a major leap.

The study you linked was over a decade old, and you claim I should look at up to date info?  That wouldn't pass an entry level college course.  The data is fair, but incomplete.  My view is _objective_ and much of what you claim is _subjective_; there is a difference.  Is factory farming a factor in climate change?  Absolutely.  But it is the method and not the meat that is the problem.  If all of that was produced using renewable energy it would have exactly zero impact on climate change.  Are you willing to acknowledge that at least?

Caring about animals requires acknowledging what they are and their experience of the world.  You don't give a predator trouble for behaving like a predator, or prey for being prey.

Anticonsumption,"Yeah… I use to think this way. Then I realized the government is and always has been swayed by the rich. There’s nothing stopping rich people and corporations from slowly but surely deregulating, lowering taxes, taking away welfare programs and destroying democracy. Winning in capitalism is hoarding resources. Those with the most resources have the ability to influence government. We’ve made strides (which are currently being rolled back) but this is still the case. The way in which capitalism works is antithetical to democracy. A few at the top have all the power and thus the ability to influence our government which results in the government doing the bidding of the powerful and not what’s best for the majority. We can’t have true democracy and capitalism. The only way for us to have a federal government to iron out the flaws is to take power away from corporations and the only lasting way to do that is to give those corporations over to the workers. This evens out the playing field in terms of powerful and political influence. Tax increase and the like can and have been rolled back with time. 

You also kind of swept capitalism’s flaws under the rug. Currently we are on the brink of destroying our planet largely due to the profit motive. Governments around the world know climate change is happening and will continue to get worse yet nothing substantial is done. Why is that? Well because oil companies and other multinational corporations lobby to keep business going as usual. Set climate change aside, how about the exploitation of the third world? Companies like nestle use child slave labor in Africa in order to keep chocolate profitable. What about how we have economic crashes every 8 years or so? The last one in 08 destroyed hundreds if not millions of lives. And these crashes are just apart of the system. They’ve been happening for hundreds of years. These are of course just three flaws but they’re pretty big ones.. Sure, it’s better than feudalism (although I would argue we are headed towards neofeudalism) but we as a society can and should try to improve. I think work owned co-ops could send us in the right direction. Just because something was better than what we had previously doesn’t mean we should stop here. There are alternatives which would better suit the vast majority of this planet. Sorry for writing a short book, I was bored. Also I hope you don’t feel like I’m trying to preach to you, I’m just laying out some food for thought. Like I said, I use to think the same way then I learned more about socialism.

Anticonsumption,"I was an avid communist for some time before I began taking a critical look at the history of communism and the present day situation under capitalism. Although I agree with your claim large corporations are a problem, handing the corporation over to the workers would accomplish nothing. The competitive nature of capitalism encourages competition for the top, and as a result the most competent individual wins, else the corporation goes bankrupt. The workers would have no clue how to run the corporation. 

I do agree however that money politics is an issue, however the solution resides in a crackdown on lobbyists and a separate government institution controlling the paychecks of the politicians. 

Which leaps and strides are being rolled back? Carboflourocarbons and leaded gasoline both represented behemoths of the industry with almost unlimited funds, however both were banned and remain so. 

I didn’t mean to belittle capitalism’s flaws, however I don’t believe they are capitalism’s flaws. Capitalism is pretty simply the ability to do as you please as a member of a market. Of course companies will try to compel you to do things, however they really have no judicial power. This changes under socialism and communism. Marxism fundamentally takes the rights of the working class and gives them to the few and the powerful.

Climate change is a difficult beast to tackle, and you are right there are companies not doing as they should with regards to it. However, I would argue that is not a flaw of the system. The USSR was itself an ecological disaster. Poor welding on oil well pipes, hastily covered up chemical spills, and catastrophically bad air pollution. China is poised to overtake them. Both of these societies were at least predicated on socialist values. That is why they were labeled as such, and why there is so much aversion to the idea of a socialist state. 

I work a blue collar job, and I have had many conversations with my coworkers about this. It’s unforgiving and tedious work that pays poorly, however every single one of the twenty or so people I’ve addressed about socialist ideas were diametrically opposed. They agreed, political corruption and corporate negligence need a fix, however they believed socialism was a fundamentally worse option.

Again, I believe the solution lies within using the tools of democracy to fight for what is important to us, something almost every generation before us has done. Also, the degree at which global warming is occurring is in large part due to countries like India and China. They are responsible for an order of magnitude greater pollution than any western country, and that’s before we account to human rights violations. 

I think this discourse is important. Understanding others perspectives, even if it is a bit heated, is really what will begin to heal the greatest fissure we are faced with in this age - political divide. If the rich and the powerful can divide people on arbitrary political lines they can prevent the sort of democratic movements that will oust them from power permanently. Currently, both sides of the political divide support them. On the right side, you have those who wish to maintain the system of power that got them where they are. On the left, you have those who wish to give them more power through centrally planned government solutions. (The revolutions in the USSR often gave people of power more power - just look at Armenia).

Anticonsumption,"&gt;Yes, the biggest health threat isn't a virus that has a mortality rate of around 2%, which is heavily weighted towards the elderly.

This was not necessary and is extremely disingenuous. 2% is 1 in 50 - not super long odds. You have slightly worse odds of drawing the Ace of Spades at random from a deck of cards. Would you bet your life on that? More importantly, when you only focus on the mortality rate, you are ignoring the full context of what Covid actually does. 

Person A gets infected, shows no symptoms; Person B gets moderately sick but also has long-term damage to their lungs/heart/kidneys (take your pick) which will likely be permanent; Person C get severely ill, is hospitalized for weeks and put on a ventilator for several days, gets right to the brink of death before starting a slow, arduous recovery, develops PTSD from the experience. 

When you only talk about the death rate, what you are implying is that all 3 of these outcomes are the same. That any one of these is equally acceptable. 

You are also ignoring the fact that hospitals all over the country are being overwhelmed (again) and so critical surgeries and emergency care for non-Covid patients - many of whom are fully vaccinated - are being impacted, and people are suffering as a result. 

You are right that Climate Change will bring even worse havoc to the world.

I'm 100% with you on the fact that we can't buy our way out of climate change only with technology, but you are underestimating genetic engineering with this one. From many points of view, engineering outperforms natural selection by a long shot.

I know this is counter intuitive, but think about it this way: would you rather live in a man-made house or wait for nature to build you one? Perhaps the chances that you find a natural inhabitable place are there but it will be unstable, probably unsafe, and not have many perks of an actual house, like running water or electricity. 

Natural selection is good for the survival of the species, but natural mutations are random, unpredictable and take a long time to happen. That of course is good from many points of view, but if we're talking about making a strain that has - let's say - resistance against a specific pesticide, or self pollinating plants, then it's much more convenient to do so with genome modification.

Anticonsumption,"I disagree that plastic production/pollution is not important. I know there are many types of plastic, but to simplify things let's look at polyethylene and polypropylene, two  of the most common plastics:

* Polyethylene is made from ethylene, which in turn is typically made made by steam-cracking ethane gas. Ethane gas is primarily a byproduct of natural gas production/refinement where it is separated from the main component of natural gas, methane.
* Polypropylene is made in a similar process. Instead of ethylene it is made from propene. Propene is typically made by steam-cracking propane, another by byproduct of natural gas or fractional distillation of crude oil.

These products cannot exist on the scale that they currently do without the fossil fuel industry existing. If we are to move away from fossil fuels we must move away from these plastics, and moving away from both plastics and fossil fuels simultaneously will just make the process quicker and easier. As I said yes, these are separate issues, but they are very much related and it is hard to consider one without the other.

Past that, we do not know the long term effects of microplastics on the environment and humans. Bioaccumulation of this stuff is very real and it is going to be decades before we know the real implications of what we've created. Yes, there is a possibility that it isn't a health hazard, but there's also a possibility that it is and if that is the case combating the mess we've already made is going to be hard enough, let alone if we keep on adding fuel to the fire. I personally would not be surprised if it turns out they are harmful as they have a tendency to absorb pollutants like PCB's and PAH's.

I get where you are coming from. Climate change is the number one problem facing humanity right now and we should not let anything hold us back from combatting it, but I don't believe that moving away from plastics will be a hinderance. If anything, I think that getting people involved in the more visible fight against plastics can help get them involved in climate activism through conversations like the one we are having right now.

Anticonsumption,"I know it's popular nowadays to hold edgy and pessemistic views of everything in an attempt to seem profound, but if you're going to do it atleast try to address the points being made.

Your Hobbesian rant on the state of human nature has *zero relation* to how the human species actually behaved in their most primitive state: as immediate return hunter-gatherers. We were *profoundly* egalitarian, people owned little property (and the property there was would be largely usufruct,) and contrary of the strict hierarchies of many other mammals and what you try to impose is human nature we had *reverse dominance* hierarchies which actively *suppressed* any individuals that tried to dominate and rule over the others. We were a cooperative species at heart, not a individualistic competitive one that left others to die. In contrast to your rant which claims that human nature is 'I need more for me at all costs,' in our so called human nature we were naturally caring and cooperative. For more [detail](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hunter-Gatherers_and_Play):

&gt;We citizens of a modern democracy claim to believe in equality, but our sense of equality is not even close to that of hunter-gatherers. The hunter-gatherer version of equality meant that each person was equally entitled to food, regardless of his or her ability to find or capture it; so food was shared. It meant that nobody had more wealth than anyone else; so all material goods were shared. It meant that nobody had the right to tell others what to do; so each person made his or her own decisions. It meant that even parents didn't have the right to order their children around; hence the non-directive childrearing methods that I have discussed in previous posts. It meant that group decisions had to be made by consensus; hence no boss, ""big man,"" or chief.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most hunter-gatherers, wherever they have been studied, live in bands of about 20 to 50 people each, counting children as well as adults. Each band moves as needed to follow the available game and edible plants. At each campsite to which they move, each family builds, from natural materials, a small, temporary hut, the construction of which usually takes just a few hours. Because the band moves frequently, material goods beyond what a person can easily carry are a burden, so there is very little accumulation of property. Each band is an independent entity. The people within the band make all of the band’s decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Nearly all researchers who write about hunter-gatherer bands emphasize the extraordinarily high value they place on individual autonomy.** Hunter-gatherers’ sense of autonomy is different from the individualism of modern Western capitalist cultures. Western individualism tends to pit each person against others in competition for resources and rewards. It includes the right to accumulate property and to use wealth to control the behavior of others. In contrast, as Tim Ingold (1999) has most explicitly emphasized, hunter-gathers’ sense of autonomy connects each person to others, in a way that does not create dependencies. Their autonomy does not include the right to accumulate property, to use power or threats to control others, or to make others indebted to oneself. It does, however, allow people to make their own day-to-day and moment-to-moment decisions about their own activities, as long as they do not violate the band’s implicit and explicit rules. For example, individual hunter-gatherers are free, on any day, to join a hunting or gathering party or to stay at camp and rest, depending on their own preference.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Intimately tied to hunter-gatherers’ sense of autonomy is what Richard Lee (1988) has called their “fierce egalitarianism.”** Egalitarianism, among hunter-gatherers, goes far beyond the western notion of equal opportunity. It means that nobody has more material goods than anyone else, that everyone’s needs are equally important, and that nobody considers himself or herself superior to others. Such equality is part and parcel of hunter-gatherers’ autonomy, as inequalities could lead those who have more to dominate those who have less. Hunter-gatherers, of course, recognize that some people are better hunters or gatherers than others, some are wiser than others, and so on, and they value such abilities. However, they react strongly against any flaunting of abilities or overt expressions of pride.  
&gt;  
&gt;From an economic point of view, the primary purpose of the band is sharing. The people share their skills and efforts in obtaining food, defending against predators, and caring for children. They also share food and material goods. Such sharing, presumably, is what allowed hunter-gatherers to survive, so long, in challenging conditions. The hunter-gatherer concept of sharing is different from our Western concept. For us, sharing is a praiseworthy act of generosity, for which a “thank you” is due and some form of repayment may be expected in the future. **For hunter-gatherers sharing is not a generous act, nor an implicit bargain, but a duty. People are not thanked or praised for sharing, but would be ridiculed and scorned if they failed to share. Anthropologists refer to such sharing as “demand sharing.” Failing to share, if you have more than someone else, is a violation of a fundamental rule of hunter-gatherer societies** (Ingold, 1999; Wiessner, 1996).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hunter-gatherers do not have “big men” or chiefs, of the sort common in collector and primitive agricultural societies, who tell people what to do. Some hunter-gatherer groups have no regular leader at all.** Others have a nominal leader who speaks for the band in dealing with other bands, but that person has no more formal decision-making power than anyone else. Decisions that affect the whole band, such as that to move from one camp to another, are made by group discussions, which may go on for hours or even days before action is taken. Women as well as men take part in these discussions. Within any given band some people are known to have more wisdom or better judgment than others, and are therefore more influential than others; but any power they exert comes from their ability to persuade and to find compromises that take everyone’s desires into account (see, for example, Silberbauer, 1982).

It's our nature of being able to cooperate in such complex ways, of behaving as egalitarian social animals, that got us so far as a species. It's through systems of repressing our cooperative and caring nature with hyper-competitive and hyper-individualist, atomizing and alienating lives that breeds the selfishness and myopic human condition we see today. And it's through that distorted lens that we try to project ourselves onto the past, as if we've always behaved this way. I'm not trying to imply hunter-gatherers were perfect or that we should return to their way of living. I am trying to say our nature is far more egalitarian and cooperative than you're positing. Creating a cooperative and caring society doesn't mean to 'relinquish our nature,' but in a sense to *embrace it* and create new political and economic systems that encourage these traits.

And to connect back to the authors post, it's due to this myopic view that we pretend we are 'superior' to nature, that we're 'above' it and can freely dominate it as we please. Climate Change is nature's answer to this belief of ours. The author isn't positing that we become hunter-gatherers again, they're asking (to use Marxist terms) to heal the rift in the metabolic process of the earth that we've nearly irreparably damaged. It means we have to understand that we're embedded in nature, not apart from it.

Anticonsumption,"I'm going to guess that if you hit economic neutrality in plastic recycling, you're probably going to be somewhat on par with or be even more expensive than more conventional material like glass, aluminum and steel (that don't deteriorate with every cycle, aka accumulate [“heat history”](https://www.all-recycling-facts.com/recycling-symbols.html)).

Just sorting plastics for recycling is a major task, as use of the famous recycling logo isn't regulated, so anyone can just slap that on anything they want. That introduces the possibility that recycling streams will be contaminated, further degrading the quality of the recycled product. And how about mixed plastics? Right now, we're offshoring this manual task to 3rd world countries with [dirt cheap labor](https://youtu.be/H1obShpfCJ4), with the expected negative impact on the local population. Do you want that on your hands and conscience? And even then, the recycled plastic product isn't pristine.

There are of course exceptions. Like clothing where the material used is known and clearly marked. Patagonia is famous for their recycling program that accepts used Patagonia items to be recycled into new products (and they repair their used items too). The constraint here is they only accept their own items, because they can deal with it end-to-end. For other consumer goods, that's really not possible.

In the end, the plastic industry is pretty much like what you'll expect from the oil and gas industry (because they are). Remember when the oil and gas industry knew of this thing called Climate Change decades ago, and not only did they not do anything to fix it, they threw truckloads of political money to gaslight and create FUD, so there will be so much hubris that no one will demand accountability from them?

Anticonsumption,"Thank you for pushing me on the issue because I did kind of ramble pedantically in a sort of nutter manner. I was sort of half awake when I wrote it so my tendency before breakfast is to be a tad aggressive and that's not cool of me.

As far as the prisoners dilemma I just mean in the broader context of things like unions, boycotts, and nations who may *want* to do what's good for the environment (at least superficially) but when faced with the growing population of like 7 billion+ it becomes harder and harder cuz all it takes is like 1% of humanity to operate outside legal, ethical, or long term norms and things get messed up.

There's an old saying ""snitches get stitches"" in gangs and it's a tacit way of gangs from beating the interogation tactics of the cops. I don't condone it's usage but it is fairly effective at preventing the prisoners dilemma from flipping gang members.

But yeah if you get a chance check out the history of ""lead"" like the metal as an industry. Because it basically was in gasoline and was being blasted into the air. When those particles got into the air it basically covered the entire earth (included non-industrialized countries) in it's poison for several generations. I'm not saying we ban all uses of lead, when I go to the dentist I'm pretty sure it protects my organs from the X-ray machine *but* much of what we pump into the air just floats around the whole planet. So table climate change cuz that's not what I'm talking about, I'm just saying do we all want clean air, clean food, clean water? Well then we have to consider game theory in economics on a global level while remembering poor people (nations specifically) just want to move forward to our quality of life while our QOL is sinking.

Anticonsumption,"It’s both, but corporations are a lot more culpable than consumers. Like a ~80-20 split. Corporations make the products, and sometimes people need them, like basic necessities like food and power, but other times, advertisers induce artificial need to encourage consumption, like artificial obsolescence of smartphones and fast fashion. But at the same time, the consumer is still the one buying the product and reinforcing the idea there’s demand for the product. 

And in terms of like, stopping climate change, while cutting production and consumption may hurt the corporate bottom line, the ultimate effect is felt downstream by the consumer having fewer goods or even a lower standard of living. An individual consumer’s effect from abstaining is insignificant, but through social change and government policy, a concerted group of individual consumers could potentially make a change.

Also, a not-insignificant amount of industry doesn’t actually interact with consumers, but rather work as government contractors or provide services for other companies.

A lot of the actions in that resource have to do with reducing consumption of resources and land (reducing plastic use, food waste, driving, meat consumption, energy use, water use). R/zerowaste also has some practical tips about wasting less, reusing what you have, etc. and then in general start taking a hard look at how much you’re buying and think about whether it’s really necessary.

Start small with the garden with maybe just a few plants. The kids will love the project. Let them plant some seeds and then remind them that they did it as they grow. My 3-year old planted some zinnias that are huge now and she loves giving the cut flowers as gifts. If you haven’t heard of it, permaculture is a great approach to gardening (and life) and there are a lot of books out there. See what your library has maybe.

Anticonsumption,"Quite an asinine attempt to appear to have an unbiased view of Marx &amp; Engels when it clearly seems that you don't understand it.

*""All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil.""* \- Marx

Marx and Engels' conceptions of nature are extremely relevant to our discussions of ecology. One thing that has to be noted is that Marx and Engels didn't like confining themselves into fields like economics or philosophy. They felt that such was limiting to both their understandings of the world and consequently of those two fields themselves. This is why they heavily studied and kept notebooks on natural sciences like [geology and organic chemistry,](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/26/173.html) and had acquainted themselves with the works of individuals like Darwin, founder of agricultural chemistry Justus von Liebig, and agronomist Karl Fraas (who argued that excessive deforestation was contributing to a change in climate) and Matthias Schleiden (who studied climate change in ancient societies.) Marx &amp; Engels' understandings of socioeconomic systems and their place in the world furthered as a result, and we can directly see the impact of understanding natural sciences within the works of Marx &amp; Engels. In Conditions of the Working Class, Engels looks directly at issues like air and water pollution, and [""Engels has influenced some of the founders of urban political ecology. Nik Heynen, Maria Kaika and Erik Swyngedouw mention that Engels already recognised in the 19th century how the ecological conditions of cities was related to the “class character” of their development. For these authors, Engels’ work helps develop an approach to understanding the history of cities whereby processes of urbanisation are inextricably linked to ecological transformations, in contrast to those accounts that treat “nature” as distinct from human activity.""](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19427786211024211)

They also conceived of what we now call the 'metabolic rift,' comparing the metabolism of the human body to a 'metabolism' of the ecological systems and world itself and our relations to it. He considered capitalism to have caused a nearly irreparable rift within this metabolism, uncaring and apathetic towards concern of the environment. To quote Marx himself in his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1864-65, Capitalism *“instead of a conscious and rational treatment of the land as permanent communal property, as the inalienable condition for the existence and reproduction of the chain of human generations, we have the exploitation and squandering of the powers of the earth.""* And as he wrote in his manuscripts for volume 2 of Capital: *“The development of culture and of industry in general has evinced itself in such energetic destruction of forest that everything done by it conversely for their preservation and restoration appears infinitesimal”*

He even spoke of industrial animal farming aswell, writing as a reaction to Wilhelm Hamm's praise of this intensive farming:

*""In these prisons animals are born and remain there until they are killed off. The question is whether or not this system connected to the breeding  system that grows animals in an abnormal way by aborting bones in order to transform them to mere meat and a bulk of fat—whereas earlier (before 1848) animals remained active by staying in free air as much as possible—will ultimately result in serious deterioration of life force?""*

Marx even stated that he believes Fraas has an 'unconscious socialist tendency' because of how he Fraas showed that *“cultivation when it progresses in a primitive way and is not consciously controlled (as a bourgeois of course he does not arrive at this), leaves deserts behind it, Persia, Mesopotamia, etc., Greece.”*

There's much more to talk about Marx &amp; Engels' conception of nature, but I'd rather keep this from being a book and would just direct anyone to Kohei Saito's 'Karl Marx's Ecosocialism.'

&gt;Once a fatal flaw was realized in the system they would break with that flaw and move on to another system. In order to make this happen it relied on a flawed view of history. For example, there really isn't such a thing as feudalism... at least... not how Marx and Engels described it. What Marx and Engels called capitalism.... we would call mercantilism today.

'Finding flaws' to break with? 'Flawed view of history??' Calling today's economic system 'mercantilism??' Even if we did live in whatever definition you have of mercantilism, it isn't even mutually exclusive to capitalism. You know mercantilism is an economic policy &amp; theory and not a system itself right? Christ there's just so much wrong about this entire comment..

I'll end with a final note cause this is too exhausting to deconstruct all of.

&gt;So when Marx and Engels saw communism in the future, they saw it as coming apart as a result of capitalism's biggest flaws... fetishism of commodities.

I don't think you even understand what commodity fetishism is.

&gt;They felt that in order to create more and more complex goods it would require a more and more educated workforce and eventually that workforce would rise up and take over the means of production and form communism.

No.

&gt;Nowhere in the Marxist view is there an ability to have an environment. Marx didn't believe the peasant would rise up (Marx: A peasant is like a potato, they're all different shapes and sizes but they're all sort of the same thing). They didn't believe hunters or people living in nature would rise up. In order for Communism to happen (as Marx and Engels wanted) it would have to be a hyper industrialized hyper capitalist city like New York City, London or Paris rising up to form these communes.

No. Marx wrote in his letter to Vera Zasulich that he believed the small village communities in Russia had a chance of achieving communism. It was never so simple as 'dumb peasants can't make socialism!' It's about material conditions. And the material conditions in some places at some places in times are more ripe than others. He viewed Hunter Gatherer societies as primitive communists (however westernized that may be, Marx &amp; Engels were at a time when anthropology was hardly forming. And immediate-return hunter gatherers certainly are heavily egalitarian and autonomist.)

&gt;It's always been bewildering to me that so much of environmentalists have become Marxists. The two views are entirely incompatible with each other.

Anticonsumption,"Both Marx and Engels were extensive in their understandings of natural sciences like geology, organic chemistry, agronomy, and climate history and their supposed causes at the time, keeping many notebooks on them. Marx and Engels were of course first and foremost political economists and philosophers, but especially towards the end of their lives read through many textbooks on understanding the world to further his concept of a metabolic rift, which climate change itself I'd argue is the ultimate example of.  Your analogy about comparing Marx to Trump in their understandings of climate are quite ridiculous, considering most people had little knowledge (though often felt the brute force of) the processes of environmental destruction in the 19th century, whilst Marx and Engels were reading various works and books on the history of them. Neither Marx nor Engels were ever finished with their works, which should be obvious considering Marx was planning to write six main books on understanding the world, of which all three volumes of capital were only one of. I'm far too tired to be saying the same thing over and over again so I'll just copy and paste a little section of my previous comment:

Anticonsumption,"I never said that they don't make valid points. I think that somewhere in conservative ideology there are prosocial aspects. However those prosocial things are lost in the static of complete and total bull shit. 

For example; climate change is a thing that oil companies have not only known about but addressed for decades. Yet ""climate denial"" or whatever that means is something generally/mostly/exclusively perpetrated by those on the right side of the spectrum. 

Vaccine hesitency is something that is generally also on the right. A lot less so than climate denial but it still exists *especially* at a political level by republican politicians and those on that end of the spectrum globally. Bolsonaro comes to mind. 

Income inequality is something that is stopped (not fixed mind you) to a degree by democrats. Then it's pushed further by republicans. Obama and Clinton both only kind of stopped it. Clinton actually facilitated tons of it. But the hard pushing for worse labor conditions generally comes out of republicans. The de-unionization and lower wages that are creating a class of angry working class white men....are the same ones that those angry working class white men fight on behalf of. Republicans. 

Then onto freedom, which republicans and their right-er wing counterparts seem to love screaming about. Why is it they say they believe in freedom of speech and religion and then lose their minds when gay people want to get married or someone is trans? That's literally the definition of being against freedom by limiting those people.

The right in the U.S. is a clown car of politicians that say one thing and do the opposite because they know what they have to say and who to say it to in order to get elected. It's been that way for decades. 

But the **biggest** thing is that the republicans and democrats are largely *the same party*. By that I mean neither party opposes funding the military. Neither party opposes ending the insane surveillance laws that were passed post 9/11. Neither party is really fixing anything nor have they been. Clinton handed the corporate class the deal of a lifetime between Nafta and the repeal of the law that let banks speculate on things like home loans. Obama then went onto bail the banks out.

They're way too young to understand the cost eg the iphone 13 pro I just bought is just under a month's salary for me, but I will use it for the next 5 or so years so I decided to have a good quality phone for a long time instead of cheap ones that break every three years (I am a lifetime Android user who bought mainly mid-tier phones, hence the experience)

They need to grow, all you can do, is plant the seeds in their heads eg by talking about the environment, watch David Attenborough docs with them when they stay over, kids love animals, and he mentions climate change in every video of his. Kids documentaries also introduce them to these ideas in a much more digestible and fun way, that's how I learned about the environment, climate change, and the animal kingdom that led me to be more conscious of my consumption and impact on the environment. 

Also, back in the day, reverse psychology worked on me, I was a hipster since I was born, when I was told I had something everyone else had that was a huge turn off for me. Maybe try it that way? ""Why do you want xyz, everyone else has it, how boring"" or something.

Anticonsumption,"A few things. 

We the billion richest people just flat out consume too much.

We created the problem of climate change that we’re all trying to fix. We ate all the way through the apple and spit the seeds into the sky! Buy Nothing Day is partially about owning this on the level of our personal habits.

To truly fix the climate crisis, our whole culture will have to commit to far more radical measures. But on Buy Nothing Day, the test is simple: Can you stop consuming for just 24 hours? 

From there... the last 18 months have shown that a radical new kind of lifestyle adjustment is possible, even preferable. Millions of people now practice a community-first, Buy Nothing philosophy, joining up with mutual aid projects like the hyper-local Buy Nothing groups, and adopting a lifestyle that steps back from the rampant consumerism that got us here. If we want to kill capitalism — and we do — part of that is going to be rewiring our cultural and personal rituals away from consumption and into the communal.

And the other side of the coin is that working conditions in North America are quickly eroding and deteriorating from what were already low standards under capitalism. Boycotting Black Friday from both the consumer side and the workers side is a way of letting employers and governments know where economic power lies: with the worker. It's a way of promoting union formation by letting workers know just how much power they hold — especially in a so-called ""worker shortage"". 

At the end of the day, Buy Nothing Day isn't going to solve capitalism or our rampant consumerism on its own, but it's an intentional ritual that has spread like wildfire since its inception and every year takes on new life with the mutual aid and anticapitalist activity it inspires.

Anticonsumption,"I am not suggesting that 'Musk could end world hunger', nor that it was his responsibility. If you look at the original post.  It said, The UN asked Musk to 'use a fraction of his wealth to HELP people...’  Musk implied by his response that he thought 'the UN would use (that money) in an attempt to publicly shame and embarrass him'.  My response was, there are a million or more ways to get around Musk's fear of being 'shamed and embarrassed' if that is actually the obstacle.  There are so many people suffering and in poverty because of climate change.  He could help his native South Africa, or any other country in the world for that matter.  In response to your post to me - the problem with commercial enterprises over charities is that these people have NO money.  They have nothing to trade with - they have nothing!  Musk being brilliant as he is, could re-start a micro-economy if he wanted.  For example, India (and a number of other countries) lost ALL of their crops due to locusts.  What if Musk help them reseed their entire crop, so that they don't starve next year?  Or what if he used his genius and technology to produce filters to go on those factories to stop billowing pollution into the atmosphere?...  He could create a whole manufacture plant just for that!  Or created robotics to prevent pollution in any industry.  His electric cars are a great start, but they are too expensive for most people.  What if he worked with governments in creating an infrastructure for all of those electric cars?  I think the point of the UN’s request was that Musk could do A LOT to help humanity, if he wanted to instead to sending his money to Mars and to a few people involved in making those spaceships.

Anticonsumption,"I have mixed feelings about this as someone whose family is from the middle east.

in one part, it's shitty that it's old people, politicians and CEOs who go and start these wars and young people go to fight them and lose their lives. These people have so much potential. The amount of money spent is unimaginable. 

in the other part, it's not right to say that the people we are fighting are just poor people who live in caves. the politics and ideology in the middle east is very nuanced. The people who are fighting may not have the same academic training the rest of us do, but many of them have been brainwash and are zealous about their fight. They will put effort into weapons and explosives. They do not give even 0 fucks about their women having rights or the children going to school. 

By example of Afghanistan, the way things unfolded has been a complete mess, but I am glad that some of those children and women were able to go to school for even a while, they were able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and they were able to have some hope. 

Most people do not realize the utter hopelessness of not just living in a war zone, but living in societies where even basic rights are denied and your existence is made to be negligible. Having some hope I'm sure has made a difference for many of those young people. 

While it would be nice for the wars to be over, they never will be. With the increase in global warming, there will be more droughts and lack of natural resources and more civil wars and tribalism. There is still a big need for oil, especially in developing countries.

Its apparently our responsibility to recycle, not the corporations who produce all this waste.

I'm not saying it's not our responsibility to try to change our habits... we should certainly learn how and how not to vote with our dollar or simply buy less...but corporations certainly carry more of the responsibility since they produce more carbon emissions and waste. And yet they just push it down to the consumer and say it's our fault because we demanded it. But what if there aren't any other options? Or the only other options are either way too expensive, or involves ordering them online which STILL causes carbon emissions via delivery/shipping.

Plus marketing schemes mess with our minds. Packaging, bright colors, product placement, sales tags, advertisements everywhere and all the time. Don't even get me started on advertising towards young children.  Everything is designed to appeal to our emotions and our senses.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; do you know how fucking long it takes a tree to grow compared to wheat

I certainly do. It depends on the type of tree. And you grow and harvest them in rotation, just like any other multi-year plant. 

&gt; if trees are a crop why not plant them in a field like wheat and harvest them when they grow, instead of destroying natural habitats ?

We literally do, you moron.

&gt; most of the trees environmentalists are trying to protect have grown naturally for lifetimes to match the balance of their habitat

Nope. Your ignorance is showing here. Idiots like you shut down Oregon's main industry which was harvesting and replanting trees and had been done for *literally over a century*.

&gt; how so ? just because you say so ?

No, because luddite morons like you spout off and prove it.

&gt; this is anti-consumption for ACTUAL CHANGE

Preventing trees from being managed properly like the crop they are isn't actual change, which you'd understand if you knew jack or shit about the lumber industry.

Additionally, the tree this sign is posted on isn't ""super old"". It's a few years.

Finally, if you wanted *actual change* most of you idiots wouldn't have been anti-nuke, keeping us on petroleum and coal for an extra 50 years longer than we needed to be.

As others have pointed, out, Zero Waste was originally targeted at industry, businesses who create the overwhelming bulk of the waste.  What happened was that it was co-opted and individualized, and is now seen as a movement of individual consumers, rather than a policy for the producers of plastic waste.

Individualization of systemic issues is a huge problem, and one that is difficult to fight against.  It effectively absolves the worst offenders -- large corporations and the super-rich -- of their responsibility for the problems of pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation of natural resources; and places the onus for correcting these problems on the individual, when the individual has the smallest impact, and the least power and ability to enact the sort of change needed to solve these problems before they become unsolvable, before they reach the tipping point.

Individual-based zero-waste efforts are not bad in and of themselves; but they're bad in that they do not and cannot solve the larger problem, and ultimately blame the smallest and least important contributor for that failure; while those who are most responsible and hold the most power to make effective change are let off the hook.

Mindfulness doesn’t cure everything, but a mindfulness practice can help with depression/anxiety. Something as simple as watching tea steep, slowly noticing each part of your body, or noticing what you’re seeing/hearing/feeling (physically)/tasting - and trying to focus all your attention on that for 5-10 minutes - can be helpful.

And then, okay so the fact is yes the movie don’t showcase what will happen if a comet were to hit earth but rather what would happen if we treat threats like comet that are really tangible like we treat climat change.

Then clearly the government did do stuff but reacted way to late, and even the president (the French president i will speak about what I know) admitted it!

They said a bunch of stuff, contradictory stuff on live television every day, reassuring us as much as possible every time. Like the thing about mask being not effective ! Like every scientist said it was but the government wouldn’t put them until too late when the virus was already everywhere !

For years people have being in the streets complaining about the funding of hospitals, they are understaff, it’s ridiculous and they cut down the money they were getting in health care little by little. Scientist screamed that if we don’t reinforce our health systems we will take a heavy hit as soon as a big health crisis comes. They were right and nothing was done about it until now, it’s too late thousand of people died because of that.

And covid we can see the result right now, we got lucky it’s not a much more deadly virus. And the movie don’t talk about covid but climate change as a whole

Anticonsumption,"people keep saying this but without any substantial reasoning or evidence. it reminds me of old wives tales, you just heard it enough so it must be true. the dependence on industrial agriculture in America is not born out of need due to increased population since WW2 or the industrial revolution. it was born to make profit, and all of the technologies created for mass production are not to feed people, since evidently America has a horrific food desert and hunger problem despite the extreme excess of goods America's industrial agricultural complex (I'll call AIAC) produces. this is not to mention the AIAC has partnered with other commercial and political entities to ensure dependence on commercial farming and supermarkets for ""convenience"" completely removing the aspect of self sufficiency or small local markets. 

after this explanation with actual substance and  the two refuting comments, I'm not going to engage people that derail what I'm actually talking about to talk about post colonial American farming and hunter gatherers. sustainable farming and land stewardship is neither of those things.

there is artificial scarcity that makes America still experience excessive hunger and poverty despite industrial farming because they are focused on maintaining their significance in the economy, not on feeding Americans and making sure everyone has access to food. think: most businesses slash their product when it is still edible when discarding it to maintain economic balances, instead of donating the food and alleviating unnecessary hunger that exists for no reason. 

I did not say traditional farming, which you seem to be referring to post colonial local agriculture to sustain local populations in America, which do not utilize sustainable farming practices, land stewardship and rarely permaculture. it's not comparable to what I'm referring to. the traditional American farm has done more to harm their ecosystems, utilizes finite resources like fossil fuels to produce their yield across the board, and is not sustainable. 

https://foodprint.org/issues/sustainable-agriculture-vs-industrial-agriculture/

""A common argument against sustainable agriculture is that it cannot “feed the world.” However, as noted previously, today’s industrialized agriculture has left one in nine people undernourished worldwide. This is despite the fact that agricultural production today already produces 2,800 daily calories for every person on earth – enough to feed the population of 10 billion we expect by 2050. The fact is that feeding the world is a problem of power, not of calories, and industrial agriculture has concentrated power in an increasingly small number of hands.

Additionally, research has shown that various kinds of sustainable agriculture do achieve yields in the range of those obtained by chemical-dependent methods. Depending on the circumstances and crop, sustainable yields have been shown to be equivalent, slightly greater (particularly in drought conditions, which is increasingly important as the climate changes), or 15 to 20 percent lower than those of chemical agriculture. Given how underfunded the research and development of sustainable agriculture techniques have been, especially in comparison to conventional techniques, the yield differences are relatively small, suggesting that further research investment has the potential to reveal dramatic productivity gains. ""

click the article to get the sources at the bottom, but the industrial farming complex in the US also.. is failing and is not sustainable in a literal sense, there is no reason why urban gardens and farming to feed populations as opposed to generating capital could not feed the planet, especially if done according to the natural resources of the region/locale utilizing land stewardship. there is nothing comparable to that in post world War II America --  which was NOT because of an inherent need due to increasing population, but to generate wealth and a bustling economy centered around farmers earning and spending. 

think gardens instead of lawns, urban and community gardens, sustainable farms that produce to feed, an increase in self sufficiency and technology focused on feeding not earning. permaculture works in tandem with local flora and fauna and finds out which crops can be grown on the same plot together to exponentially increase yield because of their symbiotic interaction (say one plant attracts animals that would eat insect pests helping provide a food source for local fauna and sustaining the crop from succumbing to pests, the other shades the first plant for optimal growth and creates a more robust root system they both can benefit from, both also being food producing plants)",1642570589,people keep saying without substantial reasoning evidence reminds old wives tales heard enough must true dependence industrial agriculture america born need due increased population since industrial revolution born make profit technologies created mass production feed people since evidently america horrific food desert hunger problem despite extreme excess goods america industrial agricultural complex call aiac produces aiac partnered commercial political entities ensure dependence commercial farming supermarkets convenience completely removing aspect self sufficiency small local markets explanation actual substance two refuting going engage people derail actually talking talk colonial american farming hunter gatherers sustainable farming land stewardship neither things artificial scarcity makes america still experience excessive hunger poverty despite industrial farming focused maintaining significance economy feeding americans making sure everyone access food think businesses slash product still edible discarding maintain economic balances instead donating food alleviating unnecessary hunger exists reason say traditional farming seem referring colonial local agriculture sustain local populations america utilize sustainable farming practices land stewardship rarely permaculture comparable referring traditional american farm done harm ecosystems utilizes finite resources fossil fuels produce yield across board sustainable https common argument sustainable agriculture feed however noted previously today industrialized agriculture left one nine people undernourished worldwide despite fact agricultural production today already produces daily calories every person earth enough feed population billion expect fact feeding world problem power calories industrial agriculture concentrated power increasingly small number hands additionally research shown various kinds sustainable agriculture achieve yields range obtained methods depending circumstances crop sustainable yields shown equivalent slightly greater particularly drought conditions increasingly important changes percent lower chemical agriculture given underfunded research development sustainable agriculture techniques especially comparison conventional techniques yield differences relatively small suggesting research investment potential reveal dramatic productivity click article get sources bottom industrial farming complex us also failing sustainable literal sense reason urban gardens farming feed populations opposed generating capital could feed planet especially done according natural resources utilizing land stewardship nothing comparable world war ii america inherent need due increasing population generate wealth bustling economy centered around farmers earning spending think gardens instead lawns urban community gardens sustainable farms produce feed increase self sufficiency technology focused feeding earning permaculture works tandem local flora fauna finds crops grown plot together exponentially increase yield symbiotic interaction say one plant attracts animals would eat insect pests helping provide food source local fauna sustaining crop succumbing pests shades first plant optimal growth creates robust root system benefit also food producing plants

Anticonsumption,"&gt;You're assuming that scientists aren't taking sides

why do you think i assumed that? i specifically said scientists are taking a side, they are almost universally saying that climate change is being caused by human activity and co2 emissions play a very large role in that.   

&gt;For example look how social media has taken a stance on many issues.

i don't see how that is relevant.

&gt; They discriminate on a world wide scale, you cannot assume it's harder to do this to scientists. Say the wrong thing and you get fired. Write the wrong paper, and it won't get published.

yes, if scientists do something significantly wrong they get fired, just like any position i hope. you can write a paper trying to discredit the scientific consensus. loads of people have done that. sometimes they succeeded, sometimes they didn't. why would journals not want to publish that though? if anything, everyone is going to want to read it whether its true or not. because it either sparks controversy or enlightenment. both sell more subscriptions.

&gt;The Earth has a way to balance itself out, i.e. flora - the more CO2 the more green it becomes, to reduce levels and create more oxygen. Maybe deforestation should be the primary issue, but it's not and there is no issue.

nobody denies that the earth has a way to balance itself out, especially not climate scientists. flora and fauna survived other great extinction events too, so i don't see why they wouldn't survive the current one. i haven't seen anyone claim it would be the death of life on earth.

&gt;As for doing enough on the issue, the best strategy to move a people in any direction is (create) Problem, (manufacture) Reaction, (deploy) Solution. They're manufacturing consent for a carbon tax. Which is literally a breathing tax.

i haven't seen any legislators propose a tax that includes taxation on people breathing. but i'm happy to be proven wrong.

I wonder how many of the commenters so far live in Australia, let alone near the Great Barrier Reef?


Despite our Government’s completely backwards (and downright crazy) approach to saving the GBR, us actual Australian’s are desperate for its saving!


We’re watching front-row the destruction of one of the greatest natural wonders of the world, due to climate change. Heck, even David Attenborough is campaigning our Government, and the rest of the world, to do something before it’s too late!

As an Australian, Adidas is doing something very POSITIVE with this project, for the following reasons:


- How long have people complained about major corporations not doing enough to lobby/campaign government’s to do better? Here is one doing just that, instead of explicitly promoting some other rubbish shoe of theirs. 
- Unlike places like the US, our Government fears any kind of retribution from ‘Big Business’, so something like this during the Australian Open with the WORLD WATCHING leaves our politicians completely red-faced at their inaction. 


- It’s made of recycled plastic recovered from the OCEAN, can we not acknowledge that in some way? Looking at the size of the thing, they recovered a lot of ocean plastic to make that, saving who knows how much marine life in the process. The court will also not just be discarded the next day, it will sure as heck do the rounds in exhibitions, museums, etc. 


It’s just super frustrating seeing something helpful just get destroyed by this sub, when it may not be wholly deserved upon some reflection. 


Thanks for hearing me out if you got this far! :)

""When emissions from land use and land use change are included, the livestock sector accounts for 9 per cent of CO2 deriving from human-related activities, but produces a much larger share of even more harmful greenhouse gases.

I mean, let's not beat around the bush here. Much of this is related to money. Money rooted in profits over people. 

The problems we're seeing across the globe are largely related to the financial network we currently have. We're talking about the entrenched interests in, out, and around the *Wall Street network.* It's, largely, an irrevocably corrupted network. 

**""Follow the money!""** - we often hear. Well - it all goes back to the Wall Street network, the realm, the influence. Perhaps it wasn't always such a problem and so corrupted, but it is now. **Goddamn is it corrupt.** &lt;smh&gt; 

This financial system, writ large - this opaque, centralized monstrosity - is doing far more harm than good. **We need a more decentralized, transparent financial system.**

Time and time again organizations and institutions within the network are shown to break the law - often resulting in pennies on the dollar in fines. The SEC and other regulating agencies seem to be in on the grift. [In short, they're captured.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)  

The 2008 financial meltdown is but one example in a *long list.* The Panama and Pandora papers are also important evidence, tangential, but certainly related. 

If you murder someone and steal their house... then get caught and only have to do one day in jail and have to give back the carpet in the house - you're going to continue murdering and stealing (if you're a psychopath, which much of Wall Street is). 


We're talking about [banal evil](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/hannah-arendt-on-standing-up-to-the-banality-of-evil/), for the most part, when it comes to the Wall Street network.

&gt;...[he] was instead a rather bland, “terrifyingly normal” bureaucrat. He carried out his murderous role with calm efficiency not due to an abhorrent, warped mindset, but because he’d absorbed the principles of the ... regime so unquestionably, he simply wanted to further his career and climb its ladders of power.

The *Wall Street regime/network* is directly tied to:

* lobbying against healthcare reform

* fostering and encouraging ignorance of climate change 
* skewed/corrupted banking policy and basic inflation
* outright criminality; i.e. fraud, theft, national and international bribery and lobbying, etc..

Anticonsumption,"Its always like this. Any subreddit that has the potential to become a bipartisan rallying point, where people could discuss solution to something they all dislike in the world (trash, waste and overconsumption is something hated by both people on the left and the right) instead gets overrun by /r/antiwork -tier communists and just devolves into just another lefty circlejerk.

Speaking of capitalism, I have a couple of things to say as a Rightoid.

There is a misconception that gets constantly posted by reddit commies, which is that under capitalism wastefulness is incentivized. It is literally the other way around. 

Competition means that only the least wasteful methods of production, transportation etc. survive. The reason that things are the way they are right now, is because:

1. the **cost** of environmental damage is not accounted for in the calculation that companies use to determine the least wasteful methods of making and moving their product. (Plastic bags require absolutely miniscule amounts of energy and material to make, compared to any other bag, and do their job well enough, the problem with them of course is that they last *too* long)

2. corruption 

3. the tragedy of the commons

Neither of these 3 are unique to capitalism and if you look at centralized economies, they had trouble dealing with these as well and did an equally, if not worse, job at managing them (Lake Karachay, Aral sea, widespread corruption in soviet bloc countries etc.)

For an example of how much of this is ""the tragedy of the commons"". Capitalism in the airplane industry has actually made is so that more people can be transported per plane, for less fuel used and fewer downtime and maintenance. And that is significantly so, even in the last 40 years when the airplanes mostly stayed the same in overall construction. Wasteful methods, like the Concorde, meanwhile died out because they were not *competitive*. But why does then the industry overall produce more waste and consume more fuel than ever before? Because more people can afford to fly now than ever before. So there are more flights overall to accommodate that. Its a blessing and a curse.

If you lay it out like this, it is obvious where you need to attack to solve the problem of plastic waste, climate change etc. It's by fighting against goverment/private sector corruption and by incentivizing companies to use environmentally friendly processes and holding them all accountable (easier said than done obviously, I cant even imagine how much work it is to come up with some scheme of taxes and subsidies or similar that would be coherent, would not not punish poor people by making certain items prohibitively expensive and to somehow get literally the whole world onboard as no single nation would want to risk destroying their export market by being the first + some other hundred potential problems that I most likely missed)

It is certainly not by ""destroying capitalism"", whatever the hell that even means in any practical terms. Reddit commies like to post memes and complain but I am yet to hear one coherent sentence on how they would actually fix anything.

&gt;Make it more obvious that you're not engaging in good faith.

Make it more obvious that you're cherry picking very particular data. A famine is a very specific event and using this as the absolute measure of the success of modern industrial agriculture obscures a number of factors such as:

* absolute numbers of those who are undernourished or food insecure remaining high ([https://www.fao.org/hunger/en/](https://www.fao.org/hunger/en/)), which is not captured in the definition of a famine
* the food waste-hunger and food insecurity-obesity paradoxes, which are largely unique to modern society
* dominance of processed food and the increasing prevalence of food deserts, which, again, would not feature in the famine analysis you presented
* the looming crises of the increasing costs of pretty much all inorganic inputs
* climate change, whereby current agricultural practices contribute a significant portion of emissions
* soil and biodiversity loss, as a corollary of but distinct from climate change

Anticonsumption,"Biochar requires burning without oxygen and releases CO2. That’s not something we need in a world of global warming. I am not sure if there is a net gain of carbon stored when you use energy to make the char but then bury it to seal up the carbon.

Yes you can bury/till under crop residue to compost for the next crop. It’s still better to feed the waste to animals and then use their manure to fertilize the same fields. Burying them directly means a lot of calories are lost to bacteria breaking down the material. (Once again, capitalism ruins this closed loop by concentrating animals heavily in one area and making “manure lagoons” )

I’d also say if we want to “go down the food chain as low as we can go” blue-green algae are even better producers of calories then plants…and they don’t have cellulose walls we can’t digest like plants do. But do we really want to be eating nothing but bacterial slime cakes for food?

Yes, there may be some subsidizing of costs with growing more of certain crops just because parts can be sold as feed. But there are also ways to use animals with no “input” that help save the environment.

Ever heard of pig toilets? They’re gross but very efficient. You are definitely not feeding the pigs here any crops of any kind. Same idea for carp toilets. They provide lots of calories from a very small place. But these two are really kinda of gross so a much better example is…

Rice. Lots of people depend on rice for a staple. There are three ways to grow rice: 

Make a field, flood it, plant rice, add fertilizer, use herbicides, and insecticides. Net result is rice and loss of biodiversity.

Make field, flood it, plant rice. Net result is…not much rice as bugs and pests have no eaten your crop. Least you didn’t use pesticides though.

And lastly…make field, flood it, plant rice, add ducks. The ducks eat weeds and fertilize the rice with their manure. The ducks also eat the insect pests of rice. Net result is rice, eggs, and duck meat.

If you use the same space for all three fields, you are getting more calories from the duck field. You are also not using dangerous chemicals. The ducks are not getting anything “extra” from the farmer and are not using any sort of food a human could use. It’s a net gain for the environment, for the farmer getting more money, and society for getting more food. 

Yeah, we eat way to many animals and a most of it is sheer waste. But if we used them sparingly, and in their original purpose (not flavor, but by making bio-available calories from things inedible to humans) we still get more calories. There is a reason settlers and early towns raised plants and animals and we didn’t have stories of Little House on the Prairie living off of all vegetables.

Anticonsumption,"Alright, here's why I'm not going vegan.

1. That plant statistic is wrong. According to the [Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations,](https://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html) livestock live ""...primarily on forages, crop residues and by-products that are not edible to humans and that certain production systems contribute directly to global food security, as they produce more highly valuable nutrients for humans, such as proteins, than they consume."" Therefore the 'eats more plants' argument is wrong - 86% of the plants they DO eat are those which we wouldn't get benefit out of.
2. Calories != nutrients. Leading into that, you can find that meat has much more bioavailability of nutrients than plants do - the aforementioned study cites them as an excellent source of macro-and micro-nutrients, such as B12 and calcium. Cattle, for example, take 0.6 kg of protein and turn it into 1kg of more nutritionally valuable meat/milk - only relying on about 3kg grain.  Oh, and [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309174012003385?via%3Dihub) corroborates its nutritional value.
3. Health benefits. This PURE study says that meat can lower risks of cardiovascular disease. Before you talk about the other things in that study, here's a quote from the abstract : ""Regarding meat, we found that unprocessed meat is associated with benefit."" 
4. Sustainable meat management may actually [help to fight](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310338) climate change - that's a far cry from common claims that meat is destroying the planet. 
5. Now onto the subjectivity of ethics (feel free to ignore me here if you don't want subjectivity)- I've done some thinking on this and how eating meat and my morality align, and ultimately I've found that I can still be moral while eating meat. While industrial/factory farmed meat 100% needs to go, I find that local meat and dairy aren't exactly exploitative. Giving animals a free range, feed and shelter in exchange for their excess product and eventually a quick, relatively painless death is far better than letting them in the wild, where starvation, disease and predators will fell them quickly. Plus, animals don't exactly follow the same morality as us; their main life-goal is to pass their genetics on to the next generation. While I agree with you that factory-breeding them is wrong, letting them mate naturally is not. In fact, being farmed in a free-range/local way is much better for their goals than going wild.

Going vegan is a single most efficient and easy thing you can do for the environment. One burger uses more water than a month and a half of baths. Animal agriculture kills our forests, poisons water with shit and air with methane, and for what reason? PLEASURE.

Should I antagonize everyone that doesn't do as I do because I feel that what I'm doing is better?
For example using a Marseille soap, not using commercial deodorizing and cleaning products.

Of course I'm glad to share my way of living because it makes me feel better about destroying our planet a little slower. I feel like I'm doing my part but doing so I'm acting exactly like the people you despise but for me it's because it makes me feel good.

People are different and what makes them feel good is different. I've come to realize and accept it over the years. Some people don't value environnement and decreasing consumption. Does it make them bad people because of that?

There's so much we can do individually to prevent global warming and climatic catastrophy. If we let the gouvernements let the companies do what the fuck they want they'll sell us their shits and use marketing to make it feel good too.

Having a job full time and raising a family requires so much of someone's time and energy I can understand why they feel like they don't want to fight it and just buy something without thinking about all its impact and do a product life cycle analysis...

My point is this : I feel like we're blaming people instead of governments for letting companies sell us unsustainable products and fiscal profit being their only concern. That's how society is built and that's what really the cause of over consumption in the first place. This thing is really big when you think about it.

People talking about how good they feel about their recent purchase is a human feeling of approbation and self congratulations taking place I believe. Marketing has had the better of them but who can claim to not be influenced by social norms and any ads nowadays?

You can't blame people for being happy. Why I'm always trying to figure out is what gets them the feeling an often is a deep insecurity deep inside someone's mind that marketing folks exploit to sell their shits.

Its very existence was only able to have been propped by the transatlantic slave trade, enclosures acts, and colonialist/imperialistic ambitions, all of which were created and maintained through states. Much like feudal economies, it can only maintain its exclusionary ownership principles, from which individuals are able to extract rent and surplus, through the enforcement of the state. No business has it in their interest to want a free market, and in a sense neither does the market. Each circuit of capital seeks to valorize itself at all costs, so the irony of the capitalist market is that it destroys itself by its very nature.

My question was more of a rhetorical one, because the closest there's ever been to an alternative to capitalism was in the 1930s with Revolutionary Catalonia.

 &gt;A carbon budget is “the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers”. When expressed relative to the pre-industrial period it is referred to as the Total Carbon Budget, and when expressed from a recent specified date it is referred to as the Remaining Carbon Budget. A carbon budget consistent with keeping warming below a specified limit is also referred to as an emissions budget, an emissions quota, or allowable emissions.

Anticonsumption,"As long as I have been aware of the problem, climate change and environmental degradation have always been a massive concern for me. Learning more about the forces behind the environmental catastrophe we're currently in led me to believe this is a problem inherent to neoliberal capitalism and rampant overconsumption by first world countries at the expense of third world countries and the environment. Our system is incredibly effective at externalizing all costs of our insipid, hedonistic lifestyles in the West and giving us a false sense of security. In our hubris we think our modern way of life can survive forever, but the extreme environmental destruction we have seen in the last 100 years (and especially since the end of WWII) is the blink of an eye in the context of natural climate change and the history of human civilization. Our system is failing, but we don't see it, largely because we don't want to (though all the evidence is there). Its not a matter of if our current lifestyles and socioeconomic system will collapse, but when it will happen, and how bad will the damage be. We think we can break the laws of physics and overcome entropy, but an economic system based on infinite growth cannot sustain itself in a finite planet.

In addition to this, I think this incredible dependence we have on useless junk and consumable products, outside of its extreme environmental and human costs, is even psychologically damaging to those who would seem to be more directly benefitting from it. We have moved beyond the need of new technologies and products to satisfy our daily needs for survival, at least in developed countries. In this context, the final frontier for capitalism is marketing and propaganda, to create new wants and desires in the minds of people that didn't previously exist. In this paradigm, all of these useless goods and services are presented to us as a means of escaping our suffering. Look at how advertising has changed. Products aren't marketed on terms of their utility and function, they're marketed as a means to achieve a certain kind of lifestyle or status. In the face of alienation from ourselves and our peers, we turn to mindless consumption as a vehicle to escape. Instead of engaging with the world in any meaningful way and forging strong interpersonal relationships with the people in our lives who matter to us, or organizing collectively to enact any kind of functional change, we waste away in meaningless, false realities and hedonistic pleasures.",1649712418,long aware problem environmental degradation always massive concern learning forces behind environmental catastrophe currently led believe problem inherent neoliberal capitalism rampant overconsumption first world countries expense third world countries environment system incredibly effective externalizing costs insipid hedonistic lifestyles west giving us false sense security hubris think modern way life survive forever extreme environmental destruction seen last years especially since end wwii blink eye context natural history human civilization system failing see largely want though evidence matter current lifestyles socioeconomic system collapse happen bad damage think break laws physics overcome entropy economic system based infinite growth sustain finite planet addition think incredible dependence useless junk consumable products outside extreme environmental human costs even psychologically damaging would seem directly benefitting moved beyond need new technologies products satisfy daily needs survival least developed countries context final frontier capitalism marketing propaganda create new wants desires minds people previously exist paradigm useless goods services presented us means escaping suffering look advertising changed products marketed terms utility function marketed means achieve certain kind lifestyle status face alienation peers turn mindless consumption vehicle escape instead engaging world meaningful way forging strong interpersonal relationships people lives matter us organizing collectively enact kind functional waste away meaningless false realities hedonistic pleasures

With us throwing [77% of our soy to livestock](https://ourworldindata.org/soy) and the food shortages going on, it upsets me that meats are still being subsidized over just giving people the food directly. Why not make hemp paper and other non-tree products at home instead of cutting down ancient forests? Our governments should be expanding and improving rail infrastructure, maybe pressure the aviation industry to invest in blimp technology to reduce travel emissions.

It's not like we're lacking for intelligent solutions, it's more of getting governments to back the projects that would actually help people and the planet, instead of subsidizing oil, livestock, [fishing](https://www.oecd.org/agriculture/government-subsidies-overfishing/), and other harmful industries.

Anticonsumption,What would the fuel costs and fuel-related extra impacts on global warming be as a result of this more equitable global system of distribution?,1649805613,would fuel costs extra impacts result equitable system distribution
Anticonsumption,"The science has been clear for *decades* at this point that we need to cut our fossil fuel usage and emissions. It has been said, and has been fallen on deaf ears, or at least to those that truly matter. You can make oil companies update their logo to a green one, but you can't make them do what needs to be done. Too much money down the drain that way.

Doing something about this would cost them more than they are willing to give up (and they're not the ones who will *feel* the deathly effects, so who cares?/s), even if it would turn out to earn them a profit in the long run, they're not lifting a finger in a way that would matter. No, short term thinking and doing is where it's at, and also where capitalism has us all by our throats.

Let's be real here. **We are all going to die from climate change.** Emissions are through the roof, the Thwaites glacier is currently collapsing (it's been called the doomsday glacier for a [good reason)](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years), as is the Gulf Stream, and it truly wouldn't surprise me if we get our first blue ocean event this or next summer. Insects are dying en masse (they've been steadily disappearing since you were a kid, haven't you noticed?), heatwaves, droughts, floods, fires etc. have *all* been steadily getting worse or occuring more often. 1000 or 100 year storms are history. 

It's fine if you resent protesters like these because they make your life a little bit annoying, but they're doing it for a good reason. A futile one, but it wouldn't hurt if people would take the climate a bit more serious before they themselves get swept away in a flood, and then start bitching (if they survive) about why their government didn't do enough to prevent it. 

Feedback loops are starting up/have already started and tipping points are tipping everywhere. We are fucked. Have been for about 30-40 years now. 

We have about 10 good years left before our climate is going to get bonkers globally. Granted, it's already getting a bit bad, so just *imagine* how it will be in 10 years. Places like my country The Netherlands will flood partially, or in the cases of Miami and New Orleans and many others, they will become Atlantis 2.0's. 

All of these things that scientists have been warning about *are happening now.* We've waited too long, and now all that is left is greenwashing. The IPPC report has been **heavily** redacted, so no panic causing stuff would come out. Sure, they've said that we still have a few years left to ""turn this around"" (utter b.s), but that would be impossible to achieve. Like I said earlier, that's because of feedback loops, and the simple fact that not one single person is willing to *completely* change their life. No more car, no more motorbike, no more cheap shit that's made in China, no more plastic, no more exotic fruits (unless you pay $$$$), anything that uses oil is out of the question. Factories would either need to immediately switch to nuclear, or shut down completely. Anything that huffs out enormous amounts of emissions would have to be shut down.

Not one single person is able to live that way. Out entire way of life is dependent on capitalism. We are mere cogs in the machine that keeps this whole thing going. Stuck in a cyclical loop with no way to get out. 

Extinction Rebellion has their heart at the right place, but it's too late. If you've seen that clip from those four scientists who chained themselves up, you can see the desperation in that man, just like Dibiasky in Don't look up. It's just screaming into the void at this point, because regular people like that middle aged lady in this interview aren't going to care.

Anticonsumption,"It's annoying that we already fully understand the problem, but we aren't fixing it. Like...

* We know that the fossil fuel companies knew about climate change before the rest of us, and they even had, in their own writing, acknowledged the potential dangers, and yet they kept moving forward. They knowingly caused *many* millions to die, drove trillions of species extinct, and caused irrevocable damage to billions of lives.

* We know that billionaires pour loads and loads of money into lobbying politicians for their votes. You can literally look at whether a bill will benefit a corporation, and predict what senators' votes will be based on whether they've gotten campaign donations from that corporation or not. This has been shown *so many fucking times* that it's not even questionable at this point - it's just a widely-accepted fact.

* We know that corporations regularly abuse capitalism by engaging in anticompetitive practices that damage small businesses.

* We know that if we tax the top 1% a small fraction of their net worth, social programs across the country can be paid for, infrastructure can be fixed up, and our education system can be revolutionized.

* There's a lot more to the problem that we know here, but...

...we aren't doing shit about it.

Fossil fuel companies knowingly hurt people. That should be illegal.

Our seat of power has visible bribery going on every day. It's literally visible to all of us. That should be illegal.

We observe anticompetitive practices on the daily, which is supposed to be illegal. It really should be.

We know that these top 1% of people are fucking parasites gorging themselves on the society that supports them. They hurt all of us every day, and we...don't do anything about it.

To be clear, I'm not advocating revolution, but I do think our legal system needs to be reevaluated, and some of these crimes should most definitely be treated with appropriate, terminal reaction. Want to willingly engage in supporting the behavior of corporations that steal from the poor? Yeah, off with your head. Doing this in a generalized revolution is only going to hurt things more though, because we've seen how that tends to play out: Power gets moved, and similar structures rise.

Edit: Also, the philosophic change to the way we do law is pretty simple: People need to be held responsible for the consequences of their actions *even if the causal chain between their actions and the consequences is longer than one link.* Right now we are perfectly happy to put a murderer in jail if they do a single murder with their own hands, but if a million deaths arise as a consequence of something 50 *provable* links away from a person's actions?

Anticonsumption,"Most food crops grow best in a pretty limited geographic area. This is also impacted by farming tech availability. So what you wind up with is areas oversupplied with food crops and many that, if they relied on what could be produced locally, would be able to support lower populations than the areas with larger agricultural yields. This means fuel must be burned to carry the surplus from high agricultural production areas to lower production areas. This contributes to global warming.  While ideally, it might seem more ""fair"" for people in every part of the world to be able to reproduce at will, the reality is we don't have solar powered matter transporters and ultimately, local conditions must dictate what is sustainable, in terms of population.

And do I even need to discuss the fact that people hardly even 'control' their own countries? When individuals like Bloomberg can simply just buy his way in and then immediately drop out of elections for $500mil while I witness friends scared to death about getting a medical injury in their field in fear of bankruptcy, it should be clear this system is not equitable. Or how about when Exxon hid their climate report that was over forty years ago and clearly observed the effects of Greenhouse Gases on the planet? Or when cigarette companies closely worked (and sometimes still do) with researchers and media in order to downplay or just erase any evidence of the ills that tobacco has? Or a case I had almost forgotten about Volkswagen purposefully making their 'clean' vehicles only clean up till they passed required assessments? I could go on and on, and there are no doubt countless injustices going on that we simply aren't even aware of, but the point is that it's quite naïve to expect most people to easily jump on board with your plan, and even more naïve to think that businesses and corporations will simply tread along with it. The supposed 'freedom' to be a green consumer, I'll say as a 'green consumer' myself, is exactly pushed by companies like Shell or Exxon precisely because they know that it won't ever gain enough traction to put them out of business. It's a nice posturing that makes people feel like they're doing something rather than actually doing something i.e attacking the root of the problem, why we end up consuming this much in the first place.

And again, as someone who tries to be as responsible as possible I'm only able to do it because I live relatively well off and have the time, energy (though that's slowly been running thin over the past few years) and money to make it possible. As I've grown increasingly disillusioned by being able to make everyone a green consumer, of thinking that all it takes is to let individuals know that what they're buying isn't good for them or the environment and where to buy instead, I've come to realize that the reason they're like that in the first place is, well partially due to human nature and caring for the immediacy of their own life's situations first, but also due to the ways we're simply severed from being able to take direct action due to the ways capitalism individualizes systemic issues. A world free from exploitation, both in the third world and global north, would by its very nature require production levels to be so low as to practically put a halt to climate change. Localizing production and promoting municipal self-sufficiency would encourage community-building and caring for one another's environments more.  That meaningful work and a meaningful life would detract away from the consumerist attitudes that plague us. But all of this is in direct contestation with corporations, with the very system that literally needs to continue to grow itself in order to stay alive at all. That's why we've witnessed consumer culture (and also financialization) rise, because capitalism needed to expand to more markets and invade more and more aspects of our lives. All of this might seem normal now, relative to the fifty years or so of neoliberalism and hundreds of capitalism, but such would likely be considered absolutely crazy or insane by let's say the serfs of feudal societies or immediate-return hunter-gatherers.

Point is, go ahead, be a green consumer. I'm not against that, considering I am one. But to think that you can simply get a substantial enough amount of the global population (most of whom life in poverty and will need a substantial increase in their consumption levels in order to live a half-decent life) to follow lead and consume less is sort of a pipe dream. Considering the effects of the Koch Brothers, merely two billionaires, on the entire framing of climate change within the past forty years, we aren't going to make substantial progress by simply asking people to consume greener. I personally think that you know such is true too, maybe that's why you waive it off as human nature. But what you're doing by looking through this lens is missing the forest for the trees. I ultimately find your position to be a climate nihilism, unfortunately cloaked in the false consciousness of action. And that's exactly what corporations who'd be threatened by substantial climate action would like to hear. In fact, that's what capitalism in general would love to hear, if it were a sentient thing. As I showed earlier, GDP has not been decoupled from resource usage, meaning that as long as economies grow monetarily (a requirement for capitalism to function) then resource usage has to rise with it. And that's exactly what we've been witnessing. That's why our overshoot day continues to arrive earlier and earlier every year. If we want to reverse this and degrow our economies in order to save our planet, we would need to plunge our GDP at such a rate as to quite literally cause capitalism to collapse. Capitalism and the environment are, quite literally, incompatible with one another. It's a grow or die economy, and the only way it can grow is to continue to use resources. Increases in efficiency only lead to more consumption, because under capitalism they have to be used to grow economies further, else capitalism simply would collapse.

Any substantial movement against climate change can't be folly to the narrow-mindedness of simple green consumerism and the occasional voting of bought and sold officials every few years. It simply will never gain any real traction like that, especially not when its' situated within a culture and economy quite literally being the diametric opposite of it. Movements of climate justice have to be intersectional and meet where all the problems intersect with one another, whether it be racial justice, post-colonialism, economic justice, municipal self-sufficiency, a movement beyond precarity and alienation, all working towards moving past capitalism.

Answer me this—do you actually believe it is literally impossible for people to consume responsibly as long as they are in a capitalist system, no matter how much they care about the environment and no matter how much they want to? If so, how do you know this, and how do you account for the fact that so many people regularly do make the more responsible choice? Why do you think that number has reached its max?

And if you don’t think it is literally impossible, then in the end you must agree with me. It is possible, but people either are uneducated or don’t care enough to overcome those influences. 

My response is similar to your points about the Koch brothers, climate misinformation, etc. Yes, those are negative influences. But nonetheless, anyone who wants to know the truth can find it easily. The problem is that too many people don’t want to hear it. They choose the answer they want to hear, which is that it’s not a real problem and they aren’t required to sacrifice anything. And then there are the people who understand and acknowledge the truth, but put off the necessary action because they care more about their current comfort. Same is true for voting. Money in politics is insidious, but at the end of the day everyone still has a vote. Which many people can’t be bothered to exercise.  

In general, I’d say you’re making a leap from ‘these negative influences exist’ to ‘these negative influences can’t be overcome/outweighed.’ And I’m not seeing any evidence that is so.

This has been a decent talk, especially at getting a self-clarification of my own thoughts, which were generally somewhat there but not written out in plain enough to fully understand. I'll likely leave with this comment, as I'm still in college as an environmental economics major &amp; got a couple things to finish drafting. Your heart's clearly in the right place, but you greatly underestimate the complexity of both individuals and their relationships to institutions. I can assure you that if the solution to climate change truly was as you state, I wouldn't have majored in EE in the first place. Anyways, on with the show.

&gt;*You’ve spent a great deal of text adducing evidence that consumerism is influenced by advertising, capitalism, etc. I’m not sure why, since we already agreed that that is so. What you didn’t cite any evidence for is how strong that influence is.*

Strong enough to the point where clear connections can be made between these things and not just one but multiple problems such as as mental illnesses, escapism, substance abuse, and social isolationism. And conversely to the point where connections can be made between their opposites and measures such as wellbeing, happiness, crime rates, social participation, and trust. Considering the majority of our decision-making happens unconsciously, surprise surprise where these things affect us, I'd say that such is plenty strong. If consistent connections can be found between social isolationism and promotion of narcissistic behavior, then it's clearly something that needs to be tackled head on, not something as relegated as you make it out to be.

&gt;*Answer me this—do you actually believe it is literally impossible for people to consume responsibly as long as they are in a capitalist system, no matter how much they care about the environment and no matter how much they want to?*

As long as the infrastructure and transportation systems upon even which supposedly responsible brands rely upon are themselves unsustainable, very much so. It's not a matter of merely consuming responsibly, it's a matter of consuming less. And that has to be done on a scale that is, as I keep stating, quite literally incompatible with one of the most basic tenants of capitalism. [To quote one economics ](https://scholars.unh.edu/dissertation/463/)[dissertation](https://scholars.unh.edu/dissertation/463/):

&gt;We have demonstrated from a common sense perspective the fallacy of endless growth by extending the logic of the diminishing marginal utility to increasing consumption per capita to its limit. We have also shown theoretically that the underlying “engine” of capitalism contains contradictions with respect to convergence and have demonstrated that the data reveals trends that support our analysis. This troubling prediction connects with Chapter One’s story regarding the dangers of unequal growth and also connects with our extension in this chapter of the growth models in such a way as to test for chaotic outcomes. But we have also rolled up our sleeves and shown that the mathematics, when decoupled from the restrictions of parameter and model specification assumptions that have no grounding in empirical trends, yield outcomes that prove our thesis for a future of zero growth.  
&gt;  
&gt;**That conclusion cannot be avoided. If our developed civilization can survive every challenge that it faces, the challenge that will be left will be the transition from capitalism into some post-capitalistic world.**

Substantial degrowth is the only plausible path for humanity, and yet it's the very thing capitalism cannot handle. You cannot expect substantial changes when capitalism can only continue to function as long as resource usage (and thus far greenhouse emissions) continue to grow. Removing capitalism wont magically fix the issues at hand, but it will get rid of one of the largest barriers there is for decent progress.

Most people are jaded by the individualistic effects of markets. It's as simple as the economic free rider problem, a middle class individual will ask why they should cut back on what they're doing at the same time that they witness celebrities taking private jets with them wherever they go. Of course, the reality is that a substantial amount of the population *wants to be* the celebrity with the private jet. Again, we witness the effect that culture and economic systems have on individuals. Whilst in hunter-gatherer societies accumulation of wealth was actively shunned and egalitarianism was the norm, in the modern day we witness a sort of reversal. And as Murray Bookchin pointed out, the egalitarian and caring nature that hunter-gatherers had towards their fellow members reflected in their egalitarian outlook of nature as *""the very idea that nature is an object to be dominated by man stems ultimately to begin with from the very domination of human by human, and throughout history we have been projecting our social relationships, the way we have visualised our society, onto the natural world just as Heaven was organised in the feudal system along feudal lines, and nature was organized in the feudal system along feudal lines; just as Greek dualism made its own distinctions between wild nature and tame nature, just as so-called early human beings, primitive man, created a more egalitarian system within the natural world that reflected the egalitarian system in the social world.""*

Insofar as societal structures of relentless competition and toxic individualism shape our sensibilities and create a culture where consumerism is a social norm and various personal and societal ills are noticeably exacerbated, you have a pathological society. Insofar as you have the opposite ([which, again, we can point to immediate-return hunter gatherers as examples,](https://libcom.org/article/how-hunter-gatherers-maintained-their-egalitarian-ways-peter-gray)) you have individuals who care much more about their environment and peers. Which one would fight more for their environment shouldn't take long find out. Turns out, capitalist society is the former and by its very nature creates the former, as such is a match made in heaven to valorize its own growth. I have many friends who would probably be medically classified with climate anxiety, one of who would later give up on being a green consumer, at least partially from her own research and discussions with me (which, ironically, was not my intention at all.) The reality is simply that markets are the most impersonal tool out there, and can bring out the worst in us simply because of how impersonal it is. We don't see the environmental or ethical effects firsthand, and even if we know about it it's so normalized that we simply take it for granted, or make minor changes. It's a self-reinforcing culture, whose exploitation was built on capitalism which itself did not arise 'voluntarily' but rather upon the hundreds of years of violent dispossession of the masses of their common lands via [primitive accumulation and enclosures on one hand](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studies-in-mutualist-political-economy#toc15), and [colonialism, indigenous extermination, and the transatlantic slave trade](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/709818) on the other.

People don't quite literally do nothing about climate change. Since it's been introduced into the educational systems awareness about climate change and what causes it is common-place, of course progress will have been made in comparison to when it was scarcely known. That doesn't mean that all or even a large enough amount of people make such choices often enough to have any substantial effect on climate change. Again, resource usage among first world countries has continued to go up. Greenhouse gases continue to go up. There has been [no absolute decoupling between resource usage and GDP.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32834777/) I'm not sure why you keep ignoring this as this is the determining point of climate change. It does not matter how much people recycle (which itself is largely ineffective) or use electric vehicles if the aggregate throughput of an economy continues to rise. It'd be akin to chewing on kale on an otherwise increasingly unhealthy diet. It's at most a way for people to feel better about themselves and their effects, and at worst a mere performative show to block any actual progress. Economic Anthropologist Jason Hickel clearly points out [that](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/10/9/response-to-mcafee):

&gt;Because the United States and other rich economies have come to rely so heavily on production that happens in other countries, that side of resource use has been conveniently shifted off their books.

To correct for it, they use a more holistic metric called “raw material consumption,” or Material Footprint, which fully accounts for materials embodied in trade. When we look at this data, the story changes. **We see that resource use in the United States hasn’t been falling at all; in fact, it has been rising along with GDP. The same is true of all other major industrial economies. There has been zero dematerialization. No green growth.**

Something as seemingly minor as an annual 3% in economic growth a year would mean doubling the economy size every twenty four years. And as another paper [notes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964?journalCode=cnpe20):

&gt;But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we find that:  
&gt;  
&gt;(1) t**here is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth**, and (2) **absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5°C or 2°C, even under optimistic policy conditions.** We conclude that green growth is likely to be a misguided objective, and that policymakers need to look toward alternative strategies.

This is [built on an economic system which itself could only be constructed through violence and coercion](https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain) ([and continues to do so today in order to turn third world countries market dependent.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2013.843854?src=recsys)) [Humans are not intrinsically consumerist](https://libcom.org/article/hunter-gatherers-and-mythology-market-john-gowdy), they do not intrinsically feel that drug-like dopamine response to buying items that so many do nowadays. There are cultures with individuals that have active disdain for possessions and consumerism, and cultures that actively promote them. If you want to find out why said cultures have tendencies, you look at the material conditions and economic systems they're built upon. I'll give you a hint here: capitalist economies are the most possessive and consumerist economies in the history of mankind. And there are absolutely no good implications for our environment with that.

&gt;My response is similar to your points about the Koch brothers, climate misinformation, etc. Yes, those are negative influences. But nonetheless, anyone who wants to know the truth can find it easily. The problem is that too many people don’t want to hear it. They choose the answer they want to hear, which is that it’s not a real problem and they aren’t required to sacrifice anything.

Yes, and in more possessive and individualistic societies, people tend to behave that way much more because they feel they don't owe society anything. This is all the more reason to eventually do away with capitalism, it promotes this type of toxic behavior that capitalists can exploit to conquer and divide. That's not to say that cognitive dissonance will cease to exist after capitalism, but the degree to which it exists is a reflection of the cultural and societal norms of a society. The more egotistical one is, I'd assume the more cognitive bias they'd have. This is all the more reason to move beyond capitalism, and doesn't disprove that the political background are essentially crafted. It simply shows that there's a much richer dimension to political manipulation than merely overt transfer of money between politicians and businesses.

Perhaps you can even argue that the only reason that politics is relatively 'non-violent' in eg America is because it has been so placated and removed of any threat to corporations that there's simply no need to show overt force. That only needs to be done when, for example, a democratically elected president such as Allende comes in and wishes to nationalize some industries and give power to workers in Chile. In that case, then businesses and the government comes together in order to support a far-right military leader in a violent coup which amounts to no less than crimes against humanity. Or as one memo to Kissinger [said,](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/24/archives/not-a-nut-or-a-bolt.html)

*“Not a nut or a bolt will be allowed to reach Chile under Allende .. We shall do all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmost deprivation and poverty""*

&gt;[The CIA and private corporate interests](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm) joined right-wing elements in the Congress in campaigning against the confirmation, in addition to employing economic pressure and an abortive military operation which the commander in chief of the army died stopping. After the confirmation, CIA agents posing as U.S. military officers tried to pressure the Chilean armed forces into staging an anti-Allende coup by threat of withholding military aid. For the next three years, the CIA, State Department, and multinational corporate actors such as Anaconda, Kennecott, and the ITT Corporation conspired with the Chilean right in efforts to destabilize the economy and incite unrest against Allende. In the words of Richard Nixon, they wanted to ""make the economy scream.""

But that was 1973. Since then there has hardly been any genuinely left-wing movement in either America or much of the third world, most of them having been stamped out through [US backed dictatorships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change_in_Latin_America#:~:text=Cuba%20gained%20its%20independence%2C%20while,1898%20to%20the%20early%201930s) and covert &amp; illegal infiltrations and assassinations, such as the FBI's [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO). After having forged a new consensus through these acts, there's not much of a need for overt violence ([but the occasional attempt at regime change and backing violent nationalists is always in store incase those lousy rascals want to install a left-wing leader again.](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/08/the-nyt-admits-key-falsehoods-that-drove-last-years-coup-in-bolivia-falsehoods-peddled-by-the-u-s-its-media-and-the-nyt/)) And we live in the result of this era. We think we're free because, to quote Rosa Luxemburg, those who don't move never feel their chains. The closest there has been to a genuinely left wing movement in America is the social democracy of Bernie Sanders, yet post-cold war ideology is so powerful he's casted as a dirty socialist, and since socialists are obviously bad, he would ruin our economy, steal our bread, and starve us. When there's a genuine, socialist movement that gained as much traction as environmental, feminist, civil rights, did in the New Left socialist movement back then, perhaps then we'll see how much businesses and states really care about our votes.

&gt;As for all your links about socialism and well-being, I’m not going to get into it. I’m sure there are advantages to socialism, as there are advantages to capitalism. Everything is trade-offs. Socialism doesn’t seem to have a better solution for corruption in politics, for efficiency in production, all kinds of things. I’m agnostic about what system would actually produce better overall outcomes. As for pipe dreams—I think overthrowing capitalism is the pipe dream. It is just not going to happen anytime soon. And climate change isn’t going to wait for it to happen.

And this comment of yours sums the said consensus up completely. You have no understanding of socialism nor capitalism. It doesn't even seem like you knew what cooperatives were before this engagement. It's all about state vs market to you, and you've gobbled up all these lines to the point where it's like talking to a brick wall. The same cliche'd lines repeated over and over without any thought. No wonder why people feel so apathetic about politics. I can't imagine how life must be for people who genuinely cannot imagine a world outside of capitalism. Luckily for us, we have studies that discuss worker cooperatives and their relations to many factors in comparison with traditional firms.

&gt;**A survey of empirical research on productivity in worker-owned enterprises and cooperatives finds a substantial literature that largely supports the proposition that worker-owned enterprises equal or exceed the productivity of conventional enterprises when employee involvement is combined with ownership.** The weight of a sparser literature on cooperatives tends toward the same pattern. **In addition, employee-owned firms create local employment, anchor jobs in their communities and enrich local social capital.** The International Labor Organization has recently begun to expand its promotion of cooperatives and to explore worker ownership as useful tools for economic development in a ‘fair globalization’ strategy.

&gt;Contrary to popular thinking and to the pessimistic predictions of some theorists, **solid, consistent evidence across countries, systems, and time periods shows that worker cooperatives are at least as productive as conventional firms, and more productive in some areas. The more participatory cooperatives are, the more productive they tend to be.** Employment in a labor-managed firm is not the same thing as employment in a conventional one. In a labor-managed firm, members participate in the decisions that affect their unemployment and income risks. **They are considerably better protected against the moral hazard potentially attached to management decisions over investment, strategy, or even human resource policies. This may explain why participation in governance is so important to the performance of workers’ cooperatives (though these results have to be updated)** ***rather than the monetary incentives we have focused on for so long***\*\*.\*\* It is also a fact that workers’ participation in profit and in decisions makes it possible for worker cooperatives to adjust pay rather than employment in response to demand shocks.

&gt;We analyse how far Argentina’s worker-recovered companies (WRCs) have sustained themselves and their principles of equity and workers’ self-management since becoming widespread following the country’s 2001–2 economic crisis. Specialist Spanish-language sources, survey data and documents are analysed through four key sociological themes. **We find that the number of WRCs has increased in Argentina, and that they represent a viable production model. Further, they have generally maintained their central principles and even flourished. This occurred despite the global economic crisis, legal and financial pressures to adopt capitalist practices and management structures, the risk of market absorption and state attempts to coopt, demobilise and depoliticise the movement.** We argue that today they function as a much-needed international beacon of an alternative vision for labour and that integration of their experience has potential to revitalise the field.

&gt;He finds that codetermination laws are negatively associated with productivity, but profit sharing, worker ownership, and worker participation in decision making are all positively associated with productivity. **All the observed correlations are stronger among labor-managed firms (firms owned and controlled by workers) than among participatory capitalist firms (firms adopting one or more participation schemes involving employees, such as ESOPs or quality circles).**

&gt;Full employee ownership, under which employees enjoy dominant ownership and control rights, is an innovation which alters the relationship between employees and the organization in which they work. Although it has been hypothesized to have a number of positive implications, it has suffered from poor diffusion and survival rates overall, and selection biases have limited the generalizability of field research. We have therefore attempted to develop experimental methods to test hypotheses about the effects of employee ownership on selected economic, social, and psychological outcomes. **In our experiments, subjects in employee-owned firms exhibited higher productivity, perceived greater fairness in the pay they received and the method used to pay them, reported higher levels of involvement in their tasks, had more positive evaluations of their supervisors, and showed a greater propensity to interact with and provide assistance to their co-workers than did those in employee-owned firms.** Four areas where further research is needed are identified;

I also can’t give you meaning in life or explain duality any better than I already did.

The thing about your links and your premise is that they do not support the specific premise or discredit the specific argument I am making. 

I’m not saying that livestock do not present a SIGNIFICANT problem with greenhouse gasses. 

But, it’s still estimated to be under 4% of the problem. 

And so, without eliminating our usage (or DRASTICALLY decreasing it, to the point where we may as well just completely replace it with clean energy) of fossil fuels, dietary changes alone CANNOT save the planet. 

You seem like you really care sincerely, and so I am really hoping you take in that message. 

Again, I don’t believe it’s futile or pointless for us to try at all. I admire vegans for ethical reasons, for their commitment to animal welfare. 

I just cannot abide when they try to shame others from some moral high ground as though they are pursuing the most important thing that will address climate change when that is factually wrong. 

A healthy future for the planet includes changing agriculture completely. Vertical farming, lab grown meat, even upscaling food production from insects and fungi. These things will all be a part of a future that addresses emissions and is also more ethical to animals. 

But it is just factually VERY far off the mark to say the most important change is that all individuals become vegan. That would address less than 4% of the problem. It’s a drop in the bucket if you still have Amazon shipping shit like it does and pumping carbon into the atmosphere.

Anticonsumption,"You’re wrong. Discrediting this individual doesn’t discredit it. 

The studies that evaluate livestock INCLUDE the emissions produced in transporting them. If you factor out the fossil fuels, the impact of livestock sits well below 10%, generally agreed to be around 4%. 

Which means we need to be focusing on 90% of the problem. Fossil fuels. That is the science. 

If you eliminated the use of fossil fuels and replaced it with clean, renewable energy, that would resolve about 90% of the problem.

Anticonsumption,"lol you don’t understand the scientific method at all. 

By “factor out” I don’t mean forget about. 

I mean that the fossil fuel portion of the problem counts in the FOSSIL FUEL column, not the agriculture problem. 

Do you understand?

A simple explanation is this: imagine you can only address one: fossil fuels or ceasing livestock production.  

Ceasing livestock production would end the fossil fuels associated with livestock production but would have zero impact on the remaining impact of fossil fuels. 

However, focusing on eliminating fossil fuels would address 90% of the problem, including the majority of the problem relative to livestock. 

It addresses fuckin both. Do you understand?

And again, little to no fertilizer is needed if vertical farming is implemented. 🤷‍♀️

“The one individual action that citizens could take that would make a difference would be to demand a vast increase in spending on green-energy research and development, so that these energy sources eventually become cheap enough to outcompete fossil fuels. That is the real way to help fight climate change.”

Infrastructure, research, and pressure to implement the tech we already have and improve it would address over 90% of the problem.

Buy local, buy from humane butchers, buy meat infrequently, and get rid of your fucking lawn.

e: Since this seems to be a controversial take, I'd also like to add that putting the burden of fixing climate change/pollution on consumers is a known propaganda tactic by the worst polluters / offenders of climate change. Yes, eating less meat is certainly a good step. But you're not really going to combat climate change in any meaningful way by doing it.

If you're veg/vegan for ethical reasons, then the benefits are obvious. There are also health benefits to reducing meat consumption, and in my view, whether you are a vegetarian or not, refusing to support factory farming is *always* a good thing. 

That said, lawns are absolutely destroying local ecosystems, waste shitloads of water, and are effectively green deserts. They're a nightmare for local habitats and wildlife and ornamental gardens usually include invasive plants or plants that are not suited to the environment they are being planted in, thus requiring that much more water, care, and chemicals to keep alive.

Anticonsumption,"&gt; There’s also a class component to demanding that people go veg/vegan. It simply isn’t a viable option for a lot of people financially. From food deserts to lack of time / knowledge, it puts an undue burden on those people.

This is partly true, though a little more complicated. Globally, better finances tend to mean greater meat consumption. In the US, our food industry is more geared toward subsidizing and streamlining the animal industry, so we've got McDonald's as our cheap fast food, without a vegan equivalent, sadly. Thus, while it's technically possible to go vegan and save money (otherwise I wouldn't be able to lol), it does require a time/energy commitment for learning how to cook that many people, particularly in the working class, would encounter as an obstacle.

Which leads to a set of facts that make it easy to think something else is being implied, or feel contradictory...

1) on a moral individual level, I think that people should try to go vegan for various reasons.

2) there isn't a solution to climate change that doesn't entail a drastic curtailing of meat consumption

3) individual actions cannot solve climate change

There's a blog post called ""[She divorced me because I left dishes by the sink](https://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/)."" The gist is that the author's wife felt disrespected when the author repeatedly left dishes by the sink despite her asking him not to do that. Go read it, because my bad summary doesn't do it justice. But anyway, point is, the issue wasn't the dishes. It was his attitude. 

It would be a gross overreaction to reduce contact with your dad because of his plastic plates. However, I don't think it would be a gross overreaction to reduce contact with your dad because of his excessively hostile attitude towards something that's important to you. 

Asking him to use reusable plates or sort his waste is not a big ask for most people, and it's the kind of small thing I would hope a parent would do if it were important to their kid. Even if it isn't a small thing to him (like he would have to drive his recyclables across town) and it isn't something he's willing to do to make you happy, **he doesn't have to belittle you**. *That's* a dick move and it's heartbreaking and I would be proud of myself if I could have done what you did in that situation. 

Climate anxiety is hard because of how enormous and horrific the problem is and how helpless we are as individuals to do anything about it. The people who are saying that your dad's plastic plates aren't the problem are right. Your dad saying that you should go talk to people taking short-haul flights is also right. But you are also right, because while banning either short flights or single-use plastic is not the climate solution, we cannot solve the climate crisis without addressing those things. (Well, single-use plastic is more about plastic pollution in oceans as far as I can tell, but it falls under the save-the-planet umbrella.)

I don't care that individual action is meaningless; I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing anyway. Humanity is digging itself a giant hole, but just because I can't fill the hole in doesn't mean I should keep digging it deeper. I also believe in network effects; when someone sees me eat less meat, or walk instead of driving, or pull a reusable bag out of my purse, it demonstrates that these actions are possible, easy, and normal.

Covid has also altered us as social beings.  My niece, 9, told me that at school lunch, they're not allowed to talk to their friends.  They have to sit solo in rows 6 feet apart and just eat lunch.  Kids need a break and want to be social, and the people in power are taking it away.

Anticonsumption,"I wrote a paper on this for school, and what I did was tally up all the negative effects from cars, then investigated which of those effects were improved, worsened, or unchanged by electrification.

I considered these negative effects from cars:
- Mineral usage of vechile production 
- Ecological toxicity of vechile production
- Extraction of hydrocarbons causing pollution and habitat loss
- Transportation of hydrocarbons causing spills and mass pollution
- Emissions of hydrocarbons causing local short term air pollution (lung disease) and long term global warming (existential threat)
- Economic dependence on oil
- Noise pollution (often overlooked but The World Health Organization estimated that approximately one million healthy years of life are lost annually due to noise pollution in the European Union
- Ecologically and socially damaging impermeable land use (impermeable surfaces such as pavement block both the quantity of water re-entering the water cycle and reduce it's quality by the runoff of toxic chemicals, reducing biodiversity in general, as well as creating the 'heat dome' effect, creating either uncomfortable temperature conditions or extra electricity demand for AC)
- Road death (1million animals killed/ day in the US, 1.2 million humans killed / year globally) 
- Urban sprawl resulting in various knock on social effects (increased commuting time and energy usage, increased reliance on cars, decrease in active transportation and thus an increase in diseases related to lack of fitness, and rampant fiscal unsustainability as demand for roads increases faster than revenue from carcentric infrastructure) 
- Car dependence increasing social inequity by putting a financial burden on the lower class. (a car is a depreciating asset with a lot of maintenance costs, but for many poor people it is their most valuable asset, and what 
they rely on to get work) 

I then investigated electric vechiles and found they improved:
- Mostly eliminated concerns related to the extraction and transportation of hydrocarbons
- Reduced global warming potential by 50%
- Reduced contribution to noise pollution by 2-5 times

Worsened:
- Doubles the amount of mining required for the production of vechile
- Increased ecological toxicity from 20-40%

And has no effect on:
- Ecologically unsustainable impermiable land use
- Socially unsustainable land use
- Fiscally unsustainable car infrastructure
- Road deaths (only autonomous vechiles could save this problem with cars)
- Urban sprawl and the many knock on effects of that, increased energy use, worse health outcomes, car dependence
- Financial burden on lower class

I concluded that while Electric cars reduce the global warming potential, which is probably the most important factor in the long run, they still do not represent a sustainable solution when compared with public transport and active modes. Adopting those will allow us to enter a new paradigm of urban development that does not depend on cars and where you can get 99% of places on foot, bike, and train. Public transport absolutely blows both ICE and electric vechiles out of the water in terms of emissions and any other ecological consideration, as well as solves most of the social problems posed by car centric infrastructure.

Anticonsumption,"Great question! I’m not sure that anyone in particular should be held accountable. The reason being is because we all share some of the blame. The people who produce it, the ones that create the laws, and those of us who consume it. I think that if we crack down on the companies that produce the most (Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, P&amp;G etc) then they will find a scapegoat and nothing will really change. We need to go away from blaming those who let it happen and instead focus on solutions, and on each front (production, consumption, and judicial). We need laws that state that if you are to produce anything, then you need to make it recyclable and we need the recycling facilities put into place. Many poorer states like the ones North of Florida, don’t have basic recycling facilities for things like glass. That is of course just one part of the equation. 

Each issue is complicated and separate with plenty of nuance. For many plastic problems, there just isn’t a good alternative yet. We shit on vegetables that get sold in plastic, but have you ever stored a head if lettuce in the fridge without it being in plastic? Plastic helps preserve a number of foods for longer, so they can be transported from one corner of the world to the next. It absolutely sucks bur we’d have lots more food waste if we didn’t ship with plastics. Lots of the paper alternatives are laced with the incredibly dangerous shit that is in non-stick pans. Maybe the trick is for it not to be put in the fridge in the first place? I think that the first step in my area is actually giving a shit. Remember the first images of the Earth that were sent back from NASA? That started the environmental movement. We need a catalyst like that. This also needs to be a part if every school’s curriculum. I’ve watched people just dump trash on the streets. I imagine that people don’t care about others if they themselves aren’t able to afford food. We have people talking about going vegan to stop climate change. That is a great goal, but for the ones who are hungry… they need a meal and they will not care what it is. Everything is so intertwined that it is difficult to just focus on one problem without getting sucked into the next. If there was a cheap and scalable alternative to plastic, then we’d be using it right now and we wouldn’t have these issues. It is in no small part due to the fact that plastic is good at what it was designed to do. Namely stay around forever.

Anticonsumption,"For starters: my dad has worked on wall street since the 80s. Back then he started talking about how all the big corporations were beginning to buy up all the water rights on the commodities market. And he predicted that in a few decades, we would have water wars, because there would be no more publicly available fresh water. But more than that, global warming and the massive, exponentially growing population of the earth mean water sources are being polluted or drying up. California has been diverting the Colorado river to use for so long, there is no more Colorado river, literally. Where's that water gonna come from now? People need water to live. 

During the flint water crisis when common working people could not drink or shower or use their public water sources because it was brown with rust and toxic chemicals? Yeah, Nestle had ""purchased"" (basically for free) the rights to all of Michigan's natural water sources in lake form and groundwater. To bottle and sell, for massive profit. Now, extrapolate. What's going to happen when that happens on larger scales? Even more poverty, social unrest, famine/death, massive refugee crises, and wars, because wars are ALWAYS fought over resources.

It also means hotter summers, so that people (and crops, and farm animals, etc) will need MORE water than ever to stay alive. Need more water, in a time when water is going away. And the water there is, is privately owned and priced for maximum profit, creating artificial scarcity on top of real scarcity. 

Global warming is going to get exponentially worse with each coming year. And it's so much worse that whatever you've imagined. Here is a magazine piece that combined all the science from all relevant fields into one horrifying read:

**FROM ARTICLE** 

  
The Living Planet Report 2020 report drew on wildlife monitoring of more than 4,300 different vertebrate species - mammals, fish, birds and amphibians - from around the world. *It found that population sizes for those monitored species declined by an average of 68 percent from 1970 to 2016.*

**Forest clearing for agricultural space was the predominant cause of the decline,** the report says**, noting that one-third of the planet's land is currently being used for food production**. Human-caused climate change is another growing driver.

The United Nations published a sweeping report last year cautioning that 1 million of the estimated 8 million plant and animal species on the planet are at risk of extinction, many within decades, because of human activities. It made a similar plea for people to care, punctuated with a warning:  
""Protecting biodiversity amounts to protecting humanity,"" UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay, said at the time of the report's release.

That is more deaths in 1 year than Covid in either 2020 or 2021.  According to the WHO, 2020 Covid deaths were at about 3.3 Million word wide.

Pollution killed 3 times more people.

""The Commission noted pollution's deep inequity: 92% of pollution-related deaths, and the greatest burden of pollution's economic losses, occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).""

""This report presents an updated estimate of the effects of pollution on health, made on the basis of the GBD 2019 data, and also makes an assessment of trends since 2000. These data show that the situation has not improved, and that pollution remains a major global threat to health and prosperity, particularly in LMICs. Since 2000, the steady decline in the number of deaths from the ancient scourges of household air pollution, unsafe drinking water, and inadequate sanitation are offset by increasing deaths attributable to the more modern forms of pollution. These modern forms of pollution—eg, ambient air pollution, lead pollution, and chemical pollution—require major increases in mitigation and prevention.""

Something I noticed in the report, it left out deaths from ""extreme"" weather events.  It does mention how air pollution and Climate Changed are linked though.  

An argument could be made to have all the deaths from ""extreme"" weather to having pollution as a contributing factor and added to this tally.

In your comment, you try to find a balance in the ways of environmental destruction that humans wrought, but the majority of it is still created because of the animal agribusiness. You also mention that veganism  will ""loose the interest of lots of people"". This isn't really a good argument. Just because people try to ignore good arguments doesn't tarnish the validity of that argument.

Anticonsumption,"I think our friend's point here is at what point does one draw the line? There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. There is no possible way to exist in this society without in some way shape or form participating in it, and thereby participating in the abuse and exploitation of both human beings and other animals - you just can't get around it without collective societal change, but that's a completely different discussion. 

My point here is that *you* also exist in this society. You are participating in it, as our other friend here pointed out. The metals and plastic from your phone, the electricity you use in your home (and don't even get me started on the unethically mined materials for solar panels and wind farms, the unrecyclable solar panels that just get buried once they're no longer usable), the toxic pesticides used on the labor exploitative cotton fields for the cotton in your shirt you're wearing. It's cotton though, so it's fine, right?
 Who made your shirt? How much were they paid for it vs how much did you pay for it? Are you okay with that? Or what about the polyester (plastic) blend that once it rips you toss in the garbage? Even if you upcycle it, we both know where it's going to end up eventually. What about everything else you throw in the garbage? What happens when all that ends up in the ocean, burned to emit CO2 into the atmosphere thereby contributing to climate change and thereby causing mass animal extinction? 
Who picked the food you're eating? How much were they paid for their labor vs how much did you pay for it? What toxic pesticides were used? What fertilizer was used to grow it? Did the fertilizer contain manure from animals? Were they exploited in the process? Are you growing your own food? I can just keep going - anything metal, plastic, wood, paper or stone are all unethically produced, mined or harvested. 

What's everything in your home made of? Who made it? Where'd it come from? ""The store"" is not the correct answer. How deep is your veganism?

I like the concept of veganism. It's a great *ideal* to *strive for*. But in it's purest form even you, O Mighty *Vegan*, are not a True Vegan. You - just like the rest of us - are simply trying your best. And that is okay.

What isn't okay is going around telling people ""you're not a *real* vegan! 😤"". Lmao if our friend was having a porkchop, going out for a milkshake and calling themselves a vegan that is one thing, but to haughtily snub that the only true veganism is the kind that *you* are is totally unnecessary. 

People draw their line in different places. I know some vegans that eat honey, some that don't. Some vegans that will eat chicken eggs only if they're ethically raised, and some that don't. Some that eat strictly locally grown organic, and some  that literally just don't eat animal products and don't care where it came from. Whether *you* agree with them or not, that's not stopping them from calling themselves vegan, and living their vegan lifestyles.

Yours isn't the only kind of veganism, and I just don't see the point in looking down your nose at someone who *is literally vegan* and calling them Not Vegan Enough. Like what's your point? Lmao do you feel better? Is there a point to this? (Did you grow up feeling like you weren't good enough? Because you are.)

If you want to be a holier-than -thou type of person about veganism I suppose you have every right to be. But in all honesty shouldn't your goal be to try and have the person you're discussing veganism with want to become vegan? Do you think making someone feel bad about all the effort they're putting in already will make them want to continue, or do you think nitpicking is helpful? If you're not trying your best (meaning speaking kindly about veganism, since it's more effective than shame. As it is with literally everything?) then are you Vegan Enough?

New laws (might depend where you live) forbid donating or reselling a lot of baby stuff like old cribs, car seats, and other equipment that may pose a safety risk. Some have specific dates or ages that are banned. Others like bike helmets are supposed to be replaced any time you have an accident. You can definitely reduce your reproductive footprint by using the hand-me-down method with clothes and such, but when I had my baby people showered me with mountains of brand new items that I never asked for, and later massive trash bags full of second hand clothes from my SO's cousins. I wanted to use [reusable nappies](https://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/recycling-and-reducing-waste/at-home/avoid-waste/minimise-single-use-items/disposable-nappies) to reduce our waste, but I lived with a very unsupportive parent who refused to let me buy any, so we contributed to the landfill crisis till we got to potty training age.

[Humanity's birth rate has already dropped below replacement in much of the world](https://ifstudies.org/blog/half-the-worlds-population-is-reaching-below-replacement-fertility), so we might end up being OK after all as far as population vs enough resources such as land to grow all our food. We just need to avoid having more babies than people actually want or can support, and focus on reducing the number of animals we breed. I say this last part because [livestock already outnumber humans by 10s of thousands](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/chart-of-the-day-this-is-how-many-animals-we-eat-each-year/), and use [77% of our farmland (providing us with only a fraction of our nutrition), while the 23% of land dedicated to crops provides humanity with 83% of our calories, and 63% of our protein](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use).

As it is we are using finite resources like ground surface water which can be used in just a few generations, but take hundreds, sometimes thousands of years to recharge. Something like 2/3rds of humanity are already at risk of water scarcity, and things are getting worse as we continue to pump. [Fortunately this is something we can also tackle with a diet shift in the short term](https://www.truthordrought.com/water), but *not* having 8 kids per woman (pretty average before women had access to basic education and safe family-planning options like the pill or abortions) would also help ensure enough basic necessities such as water for us now, our children, and eventually even our grandchildren.

The general idea just involved some basic math and a little empathy for those of us squeezed together on this little ball who are already struggling to eat or have roofs over their heads.

Though, I’ve explained to him that he will end up saving money over time (not to mention lowering his plastic wastes) if he were to get a cooler from Target or Amazon or something, and getting a few of those 10 gallon bottles and refilling them at the water store that is near the house, it’s only like .35cents per gallon. But that is too complicated for him, he’d rather buy a case of water and not think about it. I’ve just noticed that it is something ingrained in him, because of all of the consumer goods for convenience coming up around the time he was a child; that he has grown to be dependent on his entire life.

Anticonsumption,"As unintuitive as it is, *unlimited growth is not actually the problem* — we live in an infinitely growing universe full of so many materials (including so much beyond earth it’s hard to even quantify) we could grow for eons. It’s the **diseconomies that growth creates** that are the issue. 

Short termism, environmental degradation, improper use of pollutingresources, a lack of wholistic models for life planetary support systems and our fellow earthlings, health and social costs, etc., these are the issues that need to be addressed.

The unlimited growth is just a model for development. It’s *how* that development is implement that needs to change. A system that continiously grows, but is in balance with the Earth and doesn’t damage it even improves long term sustainable, is perfectly acceptable.

Here is a good [summary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120515/infinite-economic-growth-finite-planet-possible.asp) with some excepts of what I’m talking about. It’s really important not to become conditioned by the screaming on Reddit to believe we should kill growth — that’s not a good or healthy idea. Our goal is to bring economic growth into alignment with sustainability on this planet by reducing physical consumption while continuing to grow economically. It’s a very, very important point that doesn’t get much attention in Reddits sounds right must be right antidisestablishmentarianistic echo chamber.

Here’s a summary of my thinking, taken from the linked article.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
-	Economic growth is often associated with environmental degradation.
-	Improvement in quality of life is what drives the desire for economic growth.
-	Increased consumption of Earth’s resources—and its negative environmental impact—has led many to conclude that economic growth is unsustainable.
-	However, economic growth can be separated from unsustainable resource consumption and harmful pollution.
-	Separating economic growth from physical growth can help attain higher standards of living without unsustainable resource consumption and harmful pollution.

Further: 

&gt;	The last couple of hundred years have seen an incredible rise in the world’s average standard of living. This increase in living standards is a result of unprecedented economic growth. But a negative effect has accompanied that growth—environmental degradation. Phrases such as “peak oil” and “climate change” have led many to conclude that we have reached the limits of economic growth and that if the growth is not curbed, it will ultimately destroy the Earth and all species that inhabit it.

&gt;	Yet, there is a conceptual error being made when economic growth is equated with environmental degradation, or at the very least, with the increasing consumption of the Earth’s resources. Despite their close connection in the past, it is theoretically possible to have limitless economic growth on a finite planet. What is needed, however, is to turn theory into actuality by decoupling, or separating, economic growth from unsustainable resource consumption and harmful pollution.

From [this excellent post](https://www.method41.com/blog/2018/11/growth-for-the-sake-of-growth-is-the-ideology-of-a-cancer-cell/) we also the following excerpts for your consideration (it’s worth a read):

&gt;	The way we build a company is based on continual growth, or else we remove the CEO. We expect the stock of a company to increase in value continually, or else we sell our shareholdings. Investment firms must produce consistent returns, or otherwise, we replace their leadership or dissolve them. We expect the GDP of a country to grow continually or deem a country a failure on the global stage. All well within the timespan of a human lifecycle. All in remarkable ignorance of nature’s model for growth.

&gt;	There is nothing wrong with the demand for growth in an expanding universe that continually reshuffles the deck of finite resources available to us, but the growth to which we contribute must improve the expanding fractal of humanity, not narrow it. And be flexible in the assignment of merit that continually enhances the dynamic equilibrium with nature we depend on for survival. The stale narrow-mindedness of our current systems is what induces the kind of cancer to challenge our renewal of long.

&gt;	Cheap and ill-conceived self-regulation of undesirable consequences derived from the improper cause is like a placebo offered to the dying, a cruel experiment that will never resolve to excellence. No system aligned with the inappropriate or frozen normalization of evolutionary truth will produce the desired outcomes to support the expanding fractal of human potential and discovery.

They continue:

&gt;	To attempt to cure the undesirable humanitarian cancer referred to in the title of this blog, derived from the deployment of growth for the sake of growth, conveys the same ignorance as a morbidly obese person complaining about their weight while picking up a full-size Starbucks Frappuccino every day. I observe this every day.

&gt;	The said obesity (in general) a consequence of an apathetic, consumerist, defeatist, enslaved, and complacent attitude on life, the real cause. Some of it induced by the narrowing standard-deviation of merit we appraise with money and thus freedom.

&gt;	I cringe equally when I hear Warren Buffet in a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting proudly explain how his investment in sugar-water has managed to trap “the innocent” in previously untainted countries with more irresponsible caloric intake, growth damaging an even greater swath of human renewal.

&gt;	We, humans, enslaved by desperate consumerism and generally tapped out of the difficult task of having to think for ourselves, easily confound cause with consequence, and in the words of Nietzsche, mindlessly hobble down many treacherous paths of grave depravity of reason.

&gt;	Nothing will fundamentally improve the excellence of humanity until we subject ourselves to the newfound discoveries of evolutionary truth, upstream. The endless downstream suboptimizations of our current systems, dangerously running out of steam already, unable to improve the excellence of humanity, acting as aging band-aids hiding the wounds of cancer soon to appear elsewhere.

**New Growth**

&gt;	Now that we covered plenty of incriminating evidence of what growth for growth sake leads to manmade cancer we can finally begin to explore what kind of growth is needed to preserve the longevity of the human species. The answer, of course, is hidden in a new and higher-level normalization from the inversion of the slides above.

https://i.imgur.com/a8Na6hH.jpg

&gt;	Our manmade concoctions (in red) must be transformed into the principles enforced by nature (in green). Complicated as this may seem at the level of consequential disparity, recognition and a higher normalization of evolutionary truth reveal a single causal change will instantly transform our manmade systems back into conformance with nature.

&gt;	No scorched earth approach or constitutional change is needed to affect the change described above. All it takes is the leadership that values our humanitarian integrity more than our desperate vile-maxim of fleeting personal interests. Changing the name of our evolutionary game and adjusting the incentives accordingly will instantly transform the behavior of participants.

&gt;	So, change is easy and can be instituted immediately yielding newfound excellence of humanity in tune with a dynamic equilibrium with nature we depend on for survival.

&gt;	Growth, for once, following how nature grows: consistent, renewable, and repeatable.

We can’t, as C.S. Lewis said, go back and change the beginning. But we can change the ending. Let’s look to bring, irrespective of the system of government or the color of the pin on your lapel, the system back into first principle alignment with nature, and by doing so we can write an ending

Even if we had a magic wand and instantly removed all the extra carbon from the atmosphere, that would do nothing to reverse all the other major existential crises we are facing: ocean acidification, deforestation, biodiversity loss and 6th mass extinction, resource depletion, pollution, etc.

The root cause of all the issues is overconsumption that led the planet to be in a state of ecological overshoot. Climate change is a symptom of overshoot.

Anticonsumption,"No, it's actual trillions. Billions is considering land animals alone. When you account for sea animals as well (fish, as well as bycatch in the form of turtles, dolphins, smaller whales, etc.), the number rises. An estimated 2.7 TRILLION sea animals are killed every single year for food and as feed for land animals. http://fishcount.org.uk/

So, if I came up to you and punched you directly in the face, what would you say? Would you get upset, would you tell me to stop, would you seek an explanation, justice perhaps? Or would you just say, welp, it's inevitable, people are punched all the time.

Do you apply this train of logic to anything else? What if someone killed your dog? If they said afterwards ""dogs die all the time"" would you consider that an acceptable justification for their harmful behaviour?

This is a nirvana fallacy. Just because we can't be perfect doesn't meant we shouldn't try at all. Eating animals is an environmental and moral catastrophe. It's the biggest source of suffering and abuse on planet earth. One of the leading causes of climate change, habitat destruction, species extinction, eutrophication, and air pollution. Our leading cause of antibiotic resistance. The leading cause of future pandemics, which will only happen faster and be stronger as time goes by.

From Wikipedia's carbon footprint page:

&gt;The use of household carbon footprint calculators originated when oil producer BP hired Ogilvy to create an ""effective propaganda"" campaign to shift responsibility of climate change-causing pollution away from the corporations and institutions that created a society where carbon emissions are unavoidable and onto personal lifestyle choices. The term ""carbon footprint"" was also popularized by BP.[7]

&gt;What mass migration? You mean the people that are forced to migrate due to climate change or US military-caused conflict?

Mass migration from third world countries into first world ones. Not even refugees, just people looking for government gibs me dats. Western Europe has had it pretty bad, but the US has it even worse. You have enough people moving through multiple countries to reach the US border to displace entire towns or multiple blocks in a large city. They create enclaves and essentially never integrate. It is beyond shit for the host country.  


&gt;The destruction of the US economy you can blame on greedy capitalists, meanwhile they've distracted the fools and convinced them to blame it on ""immigrants, the Left, gay people, aliens, Jews, etc."", and they've fallen for it hook, line, and sinker.

No. The near doubling of the US's work force, due to immigration has significantly depressed wages. The displacement of stateside workers and heavy handed laws regarding regulation pretty much made visa workers hands down the BEST for Agri-work and arguably even basic labor like construction seeing as most double up their work load. I worked as both a berry picker for filling flats and packaging for storeside shipment. If you are working here in the US, the job itself is beyond shit as are most. You will get paid more, with less work and cushier setting, if you work in retail. It has no reason to change either until visa workers are gotten rid of.  
Yes, it will raise prices and yes food will initially rot on the vine for a year. It will correct itself though, as Georgia's companies went from paying you per flat filled/per flat packaged to an hourly wage of almost 11$ an hour when the minimum wage is 7.25 an hour.   
I would also argue that the US's obsession with usury is dogshit. Debt based economies have pretty much always been shit, and when they were done away with (Look at Tudor England after the Magna Carta) they thrived. Wealth gain has to start from the bottom up and as is currently there is no way to start climbing the ladder because of overly regulatory governments and massive amounts of inflation in important sectors (like education) due to usury.  


&gt;I'm just going to assume ""degradation of social cohesion"" is a euphemism for, ""I have to see Black and LGBTQ people existing"", to which I say; get used to it or stay mad because the world has moved beyond you.

Its more like ""Everyone here in my town/block/city speaks a different language, has a different religion, has extremely dissimilar culture and views, and no common blood to tie them together."" and now we are all atomized and alone with a near zero way of building generational wealth or actually making an impact.

Similarly, electric cars produce fewer greenhouse gasses, but also contain highly toxic batteries and probably still pollute through the factories that produce the electricity that powers them.

Anticonsumption,"Also if you're worried about human exploitation, as you should be, then you should consider that all the exploitation involved with growing crops is exacerbated by the animal agriculture industry. We grow more crops to feed animals than we would need to grow if we weren't farming animals.

The argument against human exploitation in crop production actually works in favour of dismantling animal agriculture.

But consider the other humanitarian harms caused by animal agriculture and consumption:


 - The amount of money spent by governments (and tax payers) propping up animal agriculture that could be better spent on humanitarian efforts like education, human health systems, welfare, fighting world hunger and poverty etc. Most animal farming in places like the US, UK, EU can't sustain itself without a significant amount of subsidy from  government. Many operations simply aren't profitable without it. Plant based foods are cheaper to buy (as long as you aren't buying fancy vegan meat analogues), cheaper to produce, and require less agricultural subsidy when analysed as part of a food requirement and supply system.

 - The physical and psychological harm that comes to people involved with animal product production directly. E.g. working in a slaughterhouse is demanding and often horrifying work. There are disproportionate amounts of psychological issues like PTSD, substance abuse and domestic abuse associated with people working in these places than the rest of the population. The people that do this kind of work are often marginalised and exploited migrant workers. You can want to reduce animal agriculture and include the welfare of those people in your reasoning. This is a huge problem in North America and Europe right now.

 - The amount of consequential harm that comes to people that live near large scale animal farming operations from things like airborne fecal matter and land and water system contamination from slurry and brown waste. These are real concerns that currently negatively affect real people.

 - The detrimental effect that animal agriculture has on the environment and its potential to contribute to the risk of wellbeing on pretty much everyone on the planet but especially those in countries that are disproportionately affected by climate change. We are already seeing climate refugees forced to migrate away from areas where they can no longer sustain reliable crops. It will only get worse if we don't take action against emissions. Animal agriculture plays a large part in that. It's not just emissions either. Animal agriculture is a significant driver of river ecosystem destruction  from outputs like brown waste and slurry from animal farming.

 - The amount of health problems associated with our consumption of animal products. Most of the leading health concerns harming us today are exacerbated by over consumption of animal products. 

 - The amount of displaced indigenous people in areas like the Amazon that are uprooted and have their homes destroyed for the meat industry land clearing for grazing space and feed cropland. Most of the deforestation and land dispute in the Amazon is currently directly attributed to the beef industry (worldwide, not just in Brazil). Many developed countries import a huge amount of soy from cleared land in the Amazon specifically for animal feed.


This is all without considering vegan ethics (something you keep trying to mention). I get that you have a vested interest in farming animals. It's your livelihood. But that doesn't change the fact that it is antithetical to anti consumption. 

I would say the same thing to someone who works in fast fashion.

Anticonsumption,"It depends on what you’re trying to research.  Like if it is a climate change documentary, you need to look at scientific studies.  It’s good to do a little digging on the experts talking during a documentary.  Like if they are talking to a climatologist, look them up and see if they have any reputation for being legit, or a quack. 

If it’s a doc based on economics, again, look up those being treated as experts.  They may have made outlandish claims and predictions in the past that never materialized. Then look up other economists take on the subject.  

There are documentaries that make verifiably untrue claims, and there are ones that hint at things that may be untrue.  And there are ones that are amazingly accurate.  You can’t just accept them as truth because they are categorized as a documentary.  There is no law that says they have to be accurate at all.",1658068224,depends trying research documentary need look scientific studies little digging experts talking documentary talking climatologist look see reputation legit quack doc based economics look treated experts may made outlandish claims predictions past never materialized look economists take subject documentaries make verifiably untrue claims ones hint things may untrue ones amazingly accurate accept truth categorized documentary law says accurate

Anticonsumption,"Hobbies. I make music for fun with a laptop, interface, DAW, bass, guitar, and a midi keyboard. I only worry about things that I can directly change. I used to be a big worrier and struggled with anxiety, but unless a situation has a chance of killing or injuring me, I just rip the bandaid off and deal with it as straightforwardly as possible.

If I can’t control something or change something, then I simply hope for the best but don’t think about it too much. If unpleasant thoughts aren’t going to be somehow productive, introspective, or useful to me in some other way, then I just think of something else instead of festering in negativity.

Reading some basic Stoic texts has helped me stay grounded too, although you certainly don’t need some special book or “ancient wisdom” to stay calm.

For example, as a freelancer, my monthly income can vary a lot, and this quote by Seneca really reminds me that I’m the same person in good months (so I don’t get carried away by my “success”) as I am in more mediocre months (so that I don’t think less of myself or feel despair).

“It is a great man who can treat his earthenware as if it is silver, and a man who treats his silverware as if it is earthenware is no less great.”

I’m not very materialistic, so I’m pretty content with very little and don’t buy too many things. However, I really don’t stress about whether I’m a good anticonsumption person when I do buy something, since I’ve probably already thought about it a lot before the purchase and have come to the conclusion that it will add value to my life. It’s not a game I’m trying to score points in, just a general guideline to stay happy, prevent clutter, and avoid participating too heavily in a culture that turns me off",1658132736,hobbies make music fun laptop interface daw bass guitar midi keyboard worry things directly used big worrier struggled anxiety unless situation chance killing injuring rip bandaid deal straightforwardly possible control something simply hope best think much unpleasant thoughts going somehow productive introspective useful way think something else instead festering negativity reading basic stoic texts helped stay grounded although certainly need special book ancient wisdom stay calm example freelancer monthly income vary lot quote seneca really reminds person months get carried away success mediocre months think less feel despair man treat earthenware silver man treats silverware earthenware less materialistic pretty content little buy many things however really stress whether anticonsumption person buy something since probably already thought lot purchase come conclusion add value life game trying score points general guideline stay happy prevent clutter avoid participating heavily culture turns

I totally disagree with this mentality. In order for us to solve climate change, we *all* have to start changing how we consume and operate our lives. And when I say we all, I mean both individuals and corporations. Corporations run the US, that's no secret. And corporations are primarily concerned with making money. So as long as there's money to be made from running cruises, the cruise industry will continue to exist. 

But, if individual consumers begin to refuse cruises enough times a new social trend will arise. And if that trend becomes popular enough, it'll start to become apparent to the cruise lines that their consumers want to see change because it'll show up as reduced profits. Then we will see systematic changes starting to occur at the corporate level. 

The problem is if every single consumer has the attitude of ""my choices are too small to make a difference,"" then these anti-consumption social trends won't be able to gain traction, and then cruise lines won't have any monetary incentive to start making changes to how they operate.

If the US stopped all emissions immediately we’re still fucked because of China and India, their economies are just really starting to grow the way the US did and the emissions aren’t going to stop from them. Just look at the data, band aid solutions only slow down the inevitable.

It seems he's talking about energy shortage/scarcity when it comes to fossil energy. As far as I can tell, though, inherent shortage of fossil energy requires no different solution than ill consequences of continued use thereof (climate change), because both require us to reach zero fossil fuel consumption at some future date. The only real question is which one, if we don't pick up the pace as to what we're doing, will bite us sooner.

Also, while it's not logically a counterpoint to any point raised, the video author seems rather hypocritical when you look through all his other videos promoting wealth amassment and other decadence (tons of energy wastage there), though on the other hand, maybe he has just found out about this, so maybe it'll make an impact.

Anticonsumption,"Putting a price on emissions is paramount in making carbon capture worthwhile. You think saying ohhh well the tech isn’t good enough yet so there’s no point is the kind of mindset that’ll make it worthwhile eventually?

There are enough carbon storage locations identified to have a net zero on carbon emissions already. The main thing holding that back is infrastructure that requires, get this, MONEY. 

https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-has-vast-capacity-to-store-co2-net-zero-means-we-ll-need-it

Read it, it also mentions how public perception of the tech slows progress. So you saying the technology isn’t good enough yet isn’t helping at all. 

You’re literally just talking out of your ass about carbon capture because it is definitely feasible and can even be profitable. 

Carbon tax if used property can offset emissions, it shouldn’t only be a deterrent.

You can have your opinion on whether industries should be allowed to have emissions but if you actually want to be proactive and REALISTIC you should push for carbon capture and storage and proper use and utilization of carbon taxes. 

If I remember correctly it wasn’t long ago how people were saying solar wouldn’t be profitable or feasible yet here we are with solar power becoming more and more efficient because there is an industry for it. 

Call my arguments scatterbrained sure but you clearly can’t see the larger picture of what I’m saying. Bandaid solutions aren’t going to solve anything. The carbon in our atmosphere isn’t going anywhere, it has to be captured and stored. We have to achieve net zero emissions before we can even begin to reduce net carbon in the atmosphere and we aren’t even CLOSE to achieving net zero. 

Carbon capture is honestly our best bet and the fact you’re writing it off irks me much more than this private jet stuff. 

Carbon capture needs to start NOW. There may be more emissions as a result of pursuing that tech but it is essential for reversing global warming. 

I agree it’s okay to think about more than one problem at a time, in my opinion we should be more focused on reversing global warming rather than slowing it down. All people talk ever talk about is reducing emissions like that’s going to ever lead to net zero emissions and eventually negative emissions. Tax these industries, invest the money into clean energy and more importantly carbon capture. It’s simple. 

The way I see it we have a much better shot at negative emissions by taxing these industries and using the tax money in effective ways. 

I understand carbon tax doesn’t remove greenhouse gas, investing that money into carbon capture eventually WILL. Your proposed solutions don’t actually solve the problems we’re facing and you’re actively disavowing our best shot at negative emissions. Wild.

Anticonsumption,"There is a TL;DR: in case this is too long 

To understand the solution to this problem you must first understand how got this way to begin with. The reality of our situation is there have always been Elites so to speak, people who through their financial or institutional power can and have influence society in a way similar if not congruent with that of a powerful government. At some point in time presumably before colonial era or very near it a lot of these like minded Elites shared similar goals and benefited greatlyto banned together, individually they were already quite powerful in their families but with the pooling of each family's generational wealth and influence through various mediums and vast hordes of resources they became effectively capable of influencing the average person to the level of what we see today, where there are two main archetypes of accepted belief that most people fall into and both genuinely believe theirs is right and the others is wrong when the truth is right and wrong has been sprinkled into both so they can keep both sides forever twisted against each other before, before I sidetrack into the problems of our political system I get back to my point but how we counteract the evils of these Elites.

The key is to do exactly what they have but with no malicious intent essentially you find families or like minded individuals that also recognize the problems of this world and are passionately dedicated to solving them with virtuous intent and with these families you pull together your wealth your power and what little influence you have and you use that to acquire land after you have land you dedicate time to building up generational wealth to do this you must create a system where you can guarantee at least some of your progeny is willing to take up your goal this means having multiple children preferably more than three and raising them to be aware of the worlds situation and have empathy for the world and all the people lost out there that have fallen into the indoctrination. Once land is acquired we would try to diversely start up multiple businesses probably at first being simple things like honey microgreens other artisanal products that would not take decades of practice to do proficiently and by the time your children reach adulthood we can already have plans that will be primed for them to execute in terms of creating more institutional power. If we can get about 5 good families they will be able to make a good bit of generational progress before having to bring in more by which that point it won't be as hard because we will have already built a reputation to some degree with tangible progress and actual land and institutions in the works whereas now it's harder seeing as many people don't believe in the possibilities of such a dream. Once the village or whatever you would like to call it is a sufficient resources they would be able to afford to start doing things that would make their presence known to Common America doing charity work on a large scale helping communities Across America starting from one and moving to the next until there's so many towns and communities that have been directly influenced that even if we didn't have no internet presence (in case of shadow banned or similar problems) we may be known by Word of Mouth, this goal will take planning between many individuals with years of dedication ahead of them essentially their whole lives and the lives of their progeny this can only be fixed with their generational efforts and there is no other system besides the family and the communities that spring forth from families that are capable of matching the power that has arisen from these evil families, they've made sure that any other system government or institutional otherwise has been corrupted to the degree that any good people are killed removed or corrupted to not be good anymore therefore it was create our own systems our own communities and our own methods of influence in the world because all proper channels have been corrupted beyond use.

TL;DR Only through generations we can truly affect society to the same degree people have been generationally indoctrinated to be a mindless consumer. Find like minded people that passionately want to leave the world with a bit more hope than when they were alive and make it their life mission to start their own community of people that will continue to push this ideal and help every one that's lost and feels in despair because it can only get worse if nothing changes.

&gt;It is perhaps intuitive that keeping products in service for as long as possible before discarding represents environmental best practice. However, in the case of refrigerators, long life can translate to greater environmental impacts. The apparent contradiction is due to rapid increases in refrigerator energy efficiency which quickly put older units at considerable disadvantage to newer models, even after accounting for energy consumption and environmental impacts linked to production of new units and recycling/disposal of old units. In general if a refrigerator is older than 10-11 years, it is better from an environmental perspective to recycle and replace it with a new unit.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;But in reality, a lot of it would be fossil fuels.

it wouldn't.

&gt;Hydro is great, but does destroy a lot of habitat to create and it seems like dams in the states are starting to dry up.

i never argued we should employ hydro. and anything you build will destroy habitat, nuclear, solar, wind, tidal, they all take up space and thus, destroy habitat. and it doesn't matter that they are drying up in one specific place, i never argued that they should be used there. you're trying to make a strawman fallacy. again with the nuclear antirationality.

&gt;In your perfect world, all those energy sources would be implemented and generating. But that's not the case.

and in your perfect world it would be nuclear reactors, but that isn't the case either. the point is where we want to go, not what we currently have build. what a dumb point to make.

&gt;As it stands, nuclear is the best clean energy source we have to meet global demand at the moment, if we were to shut off fossil fuel power plants tomorrow.

we don't have the nuclear plants to do that lol, and if you want to switch rapidly nuclear is the dumbest way to do so. nuclear takes a decade atleast to build. solar and wind are rapid deployment, but they suffer from the duck curve. but even solutions to that would be more rapid deployment than building nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel refinement, storage and logistics everywhere. you can roll out a solar farm in 3 months and it'll have earned its initial carbon emissions won back after 6 months. within a year they are carbon negative, and continue to prevent carbon from being emitted. meanwhile nuclear would take 10 years to build and emit a shitton of co2e during production that would take years to offset. you wanna stop most emissions within a few years or you want to stop them in a decade or two? nuclear has its place, not everywhere is suited for solar and we definitely should keep viable reactors running (unless they endanger wildlife like in france currently, hence why they are shut down, so much for reliability lmao).

Where I grew up, in northern Wisconsin, we had a joke: ""The only three things you can grow around here are older, fatter, and grass.""

It wasn't technically true, but there was truth in it: our growing season was so short, that people who had farms, typically raised livestock. Meat was both the most economically sustainable way, and the most ecologically sustainable way, to use *our* land to grow food; you could raise cows across a dappled landscape of meadow and copse, a living forest far more ecologically viable than the empty deserts of corn and soy that I live among down here in Iowa.

Other lands afford other opportunities, to grow fruits and vegetables and grains.

But will they always?

One thing I learned about grass growing up is that it is very resilient. As a crop geneticist, I can tell you plainly: grasses will be one of the last known survivors as the climate changes.

You may not like it, but, unless you've figured out how to make tofu out of grass clippings, it might become most sustainable to feed the grass to livestock, and then eat those.

The elite want a much smaller world population, where everyone is chipped and tracked and monitored. That's how they stay on top forever.

What's my evidence for that the elite have this motivation, besides their own writings? Every time someone comes up within an invention or an innovation that would solve some of these admittedly real environmental problems we have, the elite come in and make sure that person's work does not ever get off the ground. Look into the guy who built the car that runs on water for example. Look into the writings of Allan savory, the African scientist who demonstrates that improper herd management is the major cause of rapid desertification in Africa, not global warming. There's plenty more examples of people coming up with real solutions to our problems that get shut down by the .01%.

If the elite wanted our environment to be healed, they would've fixed these problems easily 20-30 years ago.

The greatest con of our generation is the shifting of responsibility and blame for the earths problems onto the many when it really is about the few

Which is how corporations and corporate entities have invaded responsibility and invaded regulation and invaded all of these things because they convinced the people that it’s a collective effort that needs to be made when in all actuality it really isn’t

And that’s why the market doesn’t change

For example things that are made and have a huge environmental impact are not changed by corporations but instead for it to be changed by the people using them this is how we have such a problem with plastics still nationwide and worldwide plastics that are not biodegradable or not used we have technology for biodegradable plastics but the market has yet to use them and they say that it’s because the incentive isn’t there when in all actuality it would be their responsibility to uptake the usage of it because everyone is unwilling to change the market they all are at a standstill and blame everyone else

Not everyone is going to have the money to afford to swap to an electric vehicle or have the money to uptake greater environmentally friendly behaviors because they are now expensive because there’s a lack of competition in the market for it therefore the quickest way to make a massive amount of change while the market is shifting with corporations changing their manufacturing process for these things is to ban the very rich from using excess amounts of things that we are going to have to understandably restrict just for the poor because they cannot afford anything else

Anticonsumption,"I agree that it is imperative that the needs of vulnerable populations need to be given special attention as we build a more sustainable society.  As a disabled person in the US, I find the status quo to be drastically more dangerous to the disabled than any of the policy changes aimed at improving sustainability.  My husband works in environmental policy and disability issues are taken into account by policymakers.  There are devoted disability advocates that are engaged in the political process and do a good job holding lawmakers accountable.  

Let me address your examples:

A.  Straws: restaurants don’t need to hand out millions of them, they just have a box of them on hand if people ask.  That’s. It hard.  Most people who have special needs around drinking will bring their own equipment anyway.  

B. Transportation: it is typical in the US for the public transit agency to operate a special needs bus that comes directly to disabled people’s homes and drives them directly where they need to go.  This should be expanded along with other forms of public transport. Fewer cars on the road should make it easier for disabled people to drive, park,  move around using alternate mobility devices.   The needs of people with disabilities need to be prioritized in any transportation planning process.

C.  What kind of a-hole would suggest such a thing!  It’s not legal in the US anyway.

D. The recycling system in the US is trash, we need laws that reduce packaging and make it easier for users.  My husband works on writing these laws for his job and they are making progress.  This is a system problem that is not up to disabled people to figure out.  

E.  That’s just human decency and also a legal requirement in the US.  These laws need to be expanded and more resources are needed.  The increasing number of natural disasters as a result of climate change pose a particularly serious threat to disabled people.  A failure to address climate change will impact the poor, elderly, very young, and disabled most of all.  We have to prioritize these groups in our adaption strategies.  

If we transition to a sustainable economy, caregiving will be a job category that significantly increases. In the US, we do a terrible job meeting the needs of disabled people and caregivers.  This is largely the result of a culture that assigns value to people based on their economic output.  A sustainable society would not work under this paradigm.  

I think that it is very important to educate people on the needs of disabled people.  But it is also important to recognize that Blowhards on the internet don’t make policy.  They just make noise.  So much noise.

Anticonsumption,"How does a percentage show exactly how much product they are selling? And sales are not supposed to be secret, anyone with an infinitesimal share can request an annual accounting report and it'll show sales.

Yeah, I'm recalling some data by memory and not providing a quote, you don't have to believe me. But you're quoting Nestle themselves, and they admit that the number is untrue.

When Nestlé started selling those, no recycling facility was able to recycle compound materials. So they made their own buildings that claim to separate those, in an effort to greenwash themselves. The sad truth is, even if they separate the plastic from the aluminum, they introduce an eco-impacting process, both from the plant and the logistics involved. The plastic is discarded and the aluminum is impure and not suitable for most aluminum recycling plants. So even when it gets separated and sent to regular plants they're already at full capacity with just cans (they're easier to process). 

The only successful process they've confirmed is producing biogas and fertilizer with coffee grounds. Biogas is a nice alternative for fossil fuel but it still contributes to global warming because of the greenhouse effect.

The problem with sustainability is that no matter how you over engineer or convolute the process, each step you add impacts Earth negatively. You can't simply build more stuff to deal with the fact that you built more stuff than you needed. Recycling is a dirty process, the only clean method is one that doesn't produce any waste. There's no amount of recycling able to beat reduce and reuse. We already had a clean method for coffee, now we have a dirty one that only deals with it mediatically and won't address the real problem.

Anticonsumption,"Im sorry, but overconsumption is wrong period. I understand these businesses thrive off insecurity, but that’s almost all marketing for all groups. The stereotype of a mid life crisis man buying a sports car started as marketing to insecure men to buy something they usually wouldn’t (you’re balding? Wife left you? Feeling disgusting? Buy a fast new car!). Firearm companies routinely advertise using fear, telling consumers that the government is gonna shut them down “any day now!!!”, and to buy as much as you can. Every industry markets using insecurity, fear and anger, among other emotions. It’s usually best to not to listen to advertisers or social media - for anything really. The largest driving factor in buying things is “wanting to feel better about yourself”, whether that’s new clothes or a new toy to show off.

Anticonsumption,"yeah, I don't disgree with any of this. At the core, the problem with  this system is that we have allowed capital and the profit motive to determine our material and social existence. 

The problem is that capitalism sustains itself not just through coercion, but consent: people are forced to sell their labor to survive, but they also sell their labor because there is a structured set of incentives that in doing so they might be able to live a better life, get a bigger house, get that promotion and so forth. 

The problem here isn't just false consciousness but that there is an actual ideological alignment between the lives that people want to live and the existing system. There are all sorts of reasons that this alignment is unsustainable: it is based on exploitation of people and planet, it produces war and conflict, it generates a great deal of existential despair aand spiritual malaise  etc. etc. etc. But to over come this, we can't ignore that this system relies on the active participation of millions of people and that any large scale change will have to convince those people that this other form of life is a life worth living.   


Without doing so, the alternative ends up facing a problem of participation. In the wake of the Russian and Chinese revolutions (or El Salvador or Cuba for that matter), we saw widespread  popular participation at first as people were genuinely excited about the new worrld they were building. However, as the euphoriia of the early days receded, people's participation declined and the only way to create a system of incentive to maintain a communist mode of production was to rely on increasingly burecratized and/or coercive means of motivation.   


All this is to say that I think anti-capitalist struggle needs to grapple seriously with what motivates individuals, what sort of life they want to live, and the conditions by which political conciousness can be changed. Seizing the means of production in order to dismantle its most obscene aspects is a good idea: We need to get rid of manufactured obsolesce, personal vehicles, and so forth. But these sorts of changes will be impossible without the cultural understanding that the people who are trying to get rid personal cars (e.g.) aren't luddites intent on destroying your personal freedom, but people who are offering to a different and more appealing vision of human flourishing.   


Part of elaborating this vision of human flourishing will inevitably be creating alternatives at every scale: owning a bike instead of a car that links you to a imperial oil economy,, living in cooperatives, working with coworkers to establish direct horizontal control of your work place etc. etcc. Only when we imagine change happening in a fractal way -- working similarly across different scales -- can we imagine systemic change (indeed, capitalism's success is that the profit motiive functions to shape behavior from the smallest interaction to the largest long-term decisions of governments and corporations)",1665572502,yeah disgree core problem system allowed capital profit motive determine material social existence problem capitalism sustains coercion consent people forced sell labor survive also sell labor structured set incentives might able live better life get bigger house get promotion forth problem false consciousness actual ideological alignment lives people want live existing system sorts reasons alignment unsustainable based exploitation people planet produces war conflict generates deal existential despair aand spiritual malaise etc come ca ignore system relies active participation millions people large scale convince people form life worth living without alternative ends facing problem participation wake russian chinese revolutions el salvador cuba matter saw widespread popular participation first people genuinely excited new worrld building however euphoriia early days receded people participation declined way create system incentive maintain communist mode production rely increasingly burecratized coercive means motivation say think struggle needs grapple seriously motivates individuals sort life want live conditions political conciousness changed seizing means production order dismantle obscene aspects idea need get rid manufactured obsolesce personal vehicles forth sorts changes impossible without cultural understanding people trying get rid personal cars luddites intent destroying personal freedom people offering different appealing vision human flourishing part elaborating vision human flourishing inevitably creating alternatives every scale owning bike instead car links imperial oil economy living cooperatives working coworkers establish direct horizontal control work place etc etcc imagine happening fractal way working similarly across different scales imagine systemic indeed capitalism success profit motiive functions shape behavior smallest interaction largest decisions governments corporations

Anticonsumption,"&gt;The problem is that capitalism sustains itself not just through coercion, but consent: people are forced to sell their labor to survive,

You could have stopped there. People are forced to work. Why is it such way? Because the alternative is starvation, poverty and homelessness. If you are coerced economically, there can't really be freedom, most people want to live.

&gt; but they also sell their labor because there is a structured set of incentives that in doing so they might be able to live a better life, get a bigger house, get that promotion and so forth.

Well, first is going back to the previous one. People are forced to work, because they want to live. But since you're talking about western countries since later part pretty much doesn't apply to the rest. It happens, only because wealthier countries can abuse their economic situation to further profit from it. And since overall system needs some kind of advanced production, there will be workers for them. And in such cases, you can't really exist for long, since otherwise, people will just start rebelling and that's bad, real bad. So you give them some concessions, they are happy, and you can use the profits, to keep the rest of the world under control(well, obviously not all of it, but control is over most of it) and those poorer countries can't have such strategy since they're not wealthy, but they don't want for people to rebel, so they do it either through propaganda of things like patriotism, nationalism, religion. Or just survive on the support of army support and system is preserved through violence.

So to put it shortly, good life in western countries is possible only because of poverty in poor ones. 

Also, who's going to buy all the produce, if everyone was living in poverty? Other wealthy people? So you need to also have something that would make the money go around.

&gt;The problem here isn't just false consciousness but that there is an actual ideological alignment between the lives that people want to live and the existing system. There are all sorts of reasons that this alignment is unsustainable: it is based on exploitation of people and planet, it produces war and conflict, it generates a great deal of existential despair aand spiritual malaise etc. etc. etc. But to over come this, we can't ignore that this system relies on the active participation of millions of people and that any large scale change will have to convince those people that this other form of life is a life worth living

Because as long as people can continue living, even modestly, even in poverty, they will not be ready to die to change it. But they will be ready to change it if they can die for NOT changing it. And such times are slowly creeping in to every country in the world. US's fuck up with Afghanistan was just the signal. Just look at Russia and you'll understand what I mean. And remember that our economy is linked together, in a card piramid. Just few pieces falling, will collapse everything. Which you can notice in Europe. If Europe falls, US and China fall too and if those 2 fall as well, everything falls.

&gt;The problem here isn't just false consciousness but that there is an actual ideological alignment between the lives that people want to live and the existing system. There are all sorts of reasons that this alignment is unsustainable: it is based on exploitation of people and planet, it produces war and conflict, it generates a great deal of existential despair aand spiritual malaise etc. etc. etc. But to over come this, we can't ignore that this system relies on the active participation of millions of people and that any large scale change will have to convince those people that this other form of life is a life worth living

Well, I think that such things need their own discussions, but to put it shortly, you can't know how it's in reality and you don't know what's the reality about them, because your opinion on them isn't from those countries themselves, but by countries and people being against them.

&gt;All this is to say that I think anti-capitalist struggle needs to grapple seriously with what motivates individuals, what sort of life they want to live, and the conditions by which political conciousness can be changed.

&gt;This makes it important to precede carbon pricing with investments into33 renewable energy and low carbon transport modes, and especially support developing countries by building up low-carbon energy and mobility infrastructures and technologies, thus reducing resistance to carbon pricing. Additionally, carbon pricing receives higher acceptance if fairness and distributive consideration are made explicit in revenue distribution (see Box 5.11). The effectiveness of a policy package is determined by design decisions as well as the wider governance context that include the political environment, institutions for coordination across scales, bureaucratic41 traditions, and judicial functioning  (high evidence, high agreement). 
&gt;
&gt;Policy packages often emerge through interactions between different policy instruments as they operate in either complementary or contradictory ways, resulting from conflicting policy goals. An example includes the acceleration in shift from traditional biomass to the adoption of modern cooking fuel for 80 million46 households in rural India over a very short period of 4 years (2016-2020), which employed a comprehensive ‘policy package’ including financial incentives, infrastructural support and48 strengthening of the supply chain to induce households to shift towards a clean cooking fuel from the use of biomass. This was operationalised by creating a LPG supply chain by linking oil and gas companies with distributors to assure availability, create infrastructure for local storage along with an improvement of the rural road network, especially in the rural context. State governments initiated separate policies to increase the distributorship of LPG in4 their states. Similarly, policy actions for scaling up electric vehicles need to be well designed and coordinated where EV policy, transport policy and climate policy are used together, working on different decision points and different aspects of human behaviour . The coordination of the multiple policy actions enables co-evolution of multiple outcomes that involve shifting towards renewable energy production, improving access to charging infrastructure, carbon pricing and other GHG measures. Design of policy packages should consider not only policies that support low carbon transitions but also those that challenge existing carbon-intensive regimes, generating not just policy “winners” but also “losers” (high evidence, high agreement). 
&gt;
&gt;The winners include low carbon innovators and entrepreneurs, while the potential losers include incumbents with vested interests in sustaining the status quo. Low carbon policy packages would benefit from looking beyond climate benefits to include non-climate benefits such as health benefits, fuel poverty reductions and environmental co-benefits. The uptake of decentralised energy services using solar PV in rural areas in developing countries is one such example where successful initiatives are linked to the convergence of multiple policies that include import tariffs, research incentives for R&amp;D, job creation programmes, policies to widen health and education services, and strategies for increased safety for women and children.The energy efficient lighting transition in Europe represents a good case of the formation of policy25 coalitions that led to the development of policy packages. As attention for energy efficiency in Europe26 increased in the 1990s, policymakers attempted to stimulate energy-saving lamp diffusion through voluntary measures. But policies stimulated only limited adoption. Consumers perceived CFLs as giving ‘cold’ light, being unattractively shaped, taking too long to achieve full brightness, unsuitable for many fixtures, and unreliable. Still, innovations by major CFL and LED multinationals continued. Increasing political attention to climate change and criticisms from environmental NGOs (e.g. WWF, Greenpeace) strengthened awareness about the inefficiency of incandescent light bulbs (ILBs), which led to negative socio-cultural framings that associated ILBs with energy waste . The combined pressures from the lighting industry, NGOs and member states led the European Commission to introduce the 2009 ban of ILBs of more than 80W, progressing to lower-wattage bans in successive years. While the ILB ban initially mainly boosted CFL diffusion, it also stimulated LED uptake. LED prices decreased quickly by more than 85% between 2008 and 2012, because of scale economies, standardisation and38 commoditisation of LED chip technology, and improved manufacturing techniques. Because of further rapid developments to meet consumer tastes, LEDs came to be seen as the future of domestic lighting (Franceschini et al. 2018). Acknowledging these changing views, the 2016 and 2018 European bans on directional and non-directional halogen bulbs explicitly intended to further accelerate the LED transition and reduce energy consumption for residential lighting. In summary, more equitable societies are associated with high levels of social trust and enables action that reduce GHG emissions. To this end, people play an important role in the delivery of demand-side mitigation options within which efficiency and ‘improve’ options dominate. Policies that are aimed at behaviour and lifestyle changes come with political risks for policy makers. However, the potential exists for broadening demand-side interventions to include ‘avoid’ and ‘shift’ policies. **Longer term thinking and implementation that involves careful sequencing of policies as well as designing policy packages that address multiple co-benefits would be critical to manage interactions among supply-side and demand-side options to accelerate mitigation.**

It’s like they are still figuring it out. Errr I dunno even know.

Or how about how the very infrastructure of the united states and much of the “developed” world is designed for the efficiency of consumptions. Highways, cities and suburbs. Once upon a time the city was comprised of multipurpose neighborhoods where one could get groceries, clothing, and other day to day living needs without even needing to get on a bicycle and this was city wide in some areas. Today one needs to consume in order to consume in much of the united states at least. God damn Robert Moses, Lee Iacocca, Dwight D.

And of course, the effects of consumer culture, including pollution, climate change, and human rights abuses are on topic. 

Practical applications are on topic, too, like ideas for being more self-sufficient or reducing your own consumption. 

The core of anticonsumption, though, is addressing the system that perpetuates it, rather than a hodgepodge of discrete individual choices.

I fear that the scales have tipped too far to avoid the consequences of rampant consumerism unless there is a major paradigm shift in what is considered ""progress"" that doesn't rely upon manipulating consumers into thinking they can purchase their way to happiness.

Yes, this is all a catalyst of anxiety and anger; as another commenter said, do what you can until something changes.  To expound upon that, change can be subtle - e.g., a co-worker compliments your shirt, and you proudly tell them how it was purchased second-hand at a good price - by simply being an example, one can at least get the wheels turning in others' heads and somewhat reduce the feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness that inevitably result from the overwhelming stress of wanting to do the right thing while paddling against the current.",1666565046,personally dgaf first best recognize many succumb relentless pressure consume means filling void easier said done collective need stop defining worth materialistic standards many forces work opposing reduction consuming create false narrative extolling virtues keeping jones rather kardashians purposely disregard unsustainability consumption machine fear scales tipped far avoid consequences rampant consumerism unless major paradigm shift considered progress rely upon manipulating consumers thinking purchase way happiness catalyst anxiety anger another commenter said something changes expound upon subtle compliments shirt proudly tell purchased price simply example one least get wheels turning others heads somewhat reduce feelings powerlessness hopelessness inevitably result overwhelming stress wanting right thing paddling current

Anticonsumption,"I think it's a good thing, even if it's causing more outrage as solidarity. Those people saying ""No I won't do anything out of despise"" are just lunatics, who would have done so anyway. They are just picking this up to have an ""actual"" reason. The protests are targeting the right people: A global upper class which is causing most of climate change but will face the least impacts of it. Their priority seems to be art rather as the living conditions of people nowadays and future generations. Their outrage is exactly what's appropriate, they shouldn't feel comfortable, but their anger should be directed at the corporations and useless politicians, rather as against activists, who actually achieved media coverage. 

I believe it to be a corporate PR thing, that media is mostly covering protests which can shown in a way, that generates this form of outrage.

Anticonsumption,"Thank you for the excellent point, but I don't appreciate being talked down to. The study that you linked was on the effect of violence in antiracist protests, and while it presents some interesting points that very well may apply to environmentalism, that link hasn't been established and the two causes are vastly different.

As for your second point, yes, that's what I'd call symbolic progress. One government group telling another government group they're allowed to do something about climate change doesn't actually do anything about climate change. At least, not until the EPA actually limits carbon emissions in an enforceable way, which they haven't.

That being said, I was a bit hyperbolic in my original post. Real progress has been made. The ozone layer is getting better.

Anticonsumption,"All fair points. For example, a boycott could be considered a non-violent form of action that does work sometimes. 

However, in the context of climate change, where what needs to change is our collective over-consumption and the profit inherent in controlling hydrocarbons, *absolutely no amount* of peaceful protest will work. 

We've seen this for the last 20-30 years, and I'm pretty sure the next 20-30 years will only solidify this as a fact. 

Power seeks to protect itself, after all, and it will not relinquish control of the status quo willingly. Also, I'm having a hard time imagining a population self-voting for worst living conditions (read: less consumption) reliably.

Anticonsumption,"Yes. There are other factors in production of products that are gravely hurting our environment. Some examples:

Production costs energy, which causes CO2-emissions. Simply saying ""we'll just use sustainable energy"" is no solution: there's no way we can ramp up sustainable energy production enough to account for our current levels of production AND stay below 1.5C global warming. Even if we could, solar panels, wind turbines and batteries need a lot of rare metals which brings us to our next point...

Mining metals is extremely harmful to the environment. It destroys ecosystems, uses lots of fresh water, and leaks toxins. The labour conditions are often abhorrent. Those metals are needed for all products containing metals, like phones or cars or computers.

We could make everything from bio-baaed materials like wood or cotton or corn. But we have limited land surface suitable for agriculture. We are already using too much land surface, for example cutting down the Amazon forest to grow soy to feed our cattle. We can and should grow some plants to make bio-based alternative products, but we'd still need to find a way to make less of them.

Making good quality products and extending life-span as much as possible is an excellent way to still have the same (if not more) joy from a product, but producing a lot less. Currently, the industry is preventing that with planned obsolescence.

Your egregiously long and pedantic comment makes this sound like a difficult question by listing examples of harm caused by production of plant based foods, without making any effort to compare it to equivalent animal-based foods. This is like saying electric bikes are causing climate change because many grids still use a lot of coal, and therefore climate conscious consumers should not necessarily switch from a car to an ebike. There’s a grain of truth, but the overall message is incredibly misleading in a way that helps no one but the car industry.

Whether animal foods inherently = consuming more resources and causing more pollution than equivalent plant foods is not a complex question, at all.

Anticonsumption,"Yes, McDonald’s is a stand-in for all fast food companies including Coca-Cola which is not directly a provider but a major manufacturer of similarly unhealthy products. 

Here’s the thing: these companies make pay dirt by setting up shop in lower income and middle class neighborhoods. It’s in their best interest to keep healthy alternatives out like affordable grocery stores from the poorer neighborhoods. Giving them money perpetuates their control over low income community’s public health. Buying lentils and beans is much cheaper but that doesn’t matter much if a neighborhood doesn’t have access to that. Fast food isn’t even that cheap so poorer families are basically forced to fork over an unreasonable percentage of their income over to single meals.

In a middle class neighborhood, it’s “teehee, I’m being bad!” But in a lower income neighborhood, they don’t have a choice. Every capricious purchase funds these fast food fiefdoms because that’s functionally what they are. 

OP isn’t in a situation where they can’t afford alternatives that reduce suffering. They admitted that it’s an item they “treat” themselves to. They stated outright that they’re not going to change their habits until other people do. Does that sound like an anti-consumptionist struggling to find better food alternatives to you? Sounds like a “what’s the point? Let’s consume!” bootlicker to me. They only brought up “mental illness” when they started backpedaling on their admission of apathy. 

I know it sounds silly to think about having privilege when we are struggling to pay bills sometimes but we *do* have privileges over our poorest sectors of society. 

When we’re talking about the consequences of consumption, it’s not just the planet deteriorating. We are hurting people with fewer resources than us. We are perpetuating the forces that keep them poor. I know because I used to be poor. I’m not rich now but being able to overeat at dinner is crazy compared to where I was in 2014. 

And you know what very poor people don’t do? They don’t overconsume. They don’t make frivolous purchases to “treat” themselves. They play games with each other that don’t require giving money to Hasbro, they go to the library, they go to free socials. They put on free block parties. Where I’m from, we would dance salsa in the streets until morning and we wouldn’t spend a cent. Our activities prevented people from isolating and despairing which meant everyone had a support network. 

Privileged people overconsume. People who have the ability to make real changes in the world, to participate in social revolution but don’t, have privilege because it doesn’t affect them directly enough to care. People who have been brainwashed by companies to perpetuate the idea that you need to consume (bath bombs sold by influencers, disposable face masks, chicken nuggets in plastic containers, renting a jet ski, etc.) in order to relax or take a load off. They want the time you’re not spending working *spending your paychecks*. Until we fight against this propaganda, people will continue believing this lie. Consuming keeps you mentally unhealthy.

No capitalist and rich countries don’t care. If they cared we’d be farther along in this battle against climate change.

We’re losing, and by the end of this century our grandchildren (or us if we’re not dead yet) will have to face major famines, floods, harsher weather and of course the 2-6 Celsius rise in temperatures. Capitalism puts profit over everything. Even you. Your life means nothing except labor to capitalism. So please don’t act like capitalists are doing anything, cause they aren’t. 

Just because we put up a few wind farms here and there and use more hydroelectric energy doesn’t mean anything. We could have more renewable energy if we put profit, or even money, aside and focused more on the issue at hand. Climate change and the affects of that. But capitalists are more focused on their financial interests.

I disagree, and it does not seem clear that corporation blame preserves the status quo. Especially since corporation blame is specifically something corporations avoid with their memetics.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;These things maybe relevant to you in a personal since. And that is fine. But as it pertains to what the OP posted it doesn't.

Spinnabl’s being overly aggressive here, but they are right in that these things are relevant.

Race, gender, sex, ability, etc. all interact and come together to indicate certain things about a person in a probabilistic manner, with certain groups of course being more prone to struggling than others. A lot of these struggles play a direct role in how a person engages with consumerism, especially when looking through the lens of class disparities:

\- Being poor on a personal level means that you have a reduced capacity to choose what kinds of products you can boycott while still being able to actually survive and live healthily— not to mention that the damage from climate change disproportionately affects the poor. On a larger scale, poorer countries often struggle with disposing of waste and cannot realistically pursue clean solutions.

\- Being stressed erodes your cognitive functioning and willpower and thus leaves you more likely to make poor spending choices— it’s linked to the development of addictions, which often produce their own material garbage (such as cigarettes or alcohol). It can also directly lead to long-term physical illnesses and thus effectively leave you disabled in certain respects.

There’s a more recent post at the top of the subreddit that discusses how being overworked and stressed makes one consume more. That’s relevant for this point as well.

\- Speaking of disability, being disabled in particular often requires material goods in order to mitigate the disabling aspects. Poor eyesight means buying new glasses every few years, being paraplegic means you need a wheelchair, so on and so forth. Many mental conditions require material aids as well— I wouldn’t have been able to function without an iPad for the later parts of my schooling— and medication of course adds more waste on top of that.

\- Being undereducated can leave you more likely to live in poverty, can make you less aware of some of the more insidious aspects of consumerism, and can lead to you missing out on knowledge that could potentially reduce your consumeristic tendencies. And if you’re working multiple jobs just to stay afloat, you hardly have the time or the energy to read up on this stuff— assuming you’re ever pointed in that direction to begin with.

It’s somewhat unfair to write this sort of stuff off as identity politics when these issues genuinely do bleed into every aspect of life, this topic included. And as an aside, those sorts of labels when used right can disarm a lot of hateful stuff. I’d rather openly label myself as autistic than give others the chance to jump in and label me as weird or a loser, for example— people who fall into these categories can use those labels to seize some power over the narratives around them, which are so often filled with misinformation and prejudice.",1669090860,gt things maybe relevant personal since fine pertains op posted spinnabl overly aggressive right things relevant race gender sex ability etc interact come together indicate certain things person probabilistic manner certain groups course prone struggling others lot struggles play direct role person engages consumerism especially looking lens class disparities poor personal level means reduced capacity choose kinds products boycott still able actually survive live damage disproportionately affects poor larger scale poorer countries often struggle disposing waste realistically pursue clean solutions stressed erodes cognitive functioning willpower thus leaves likely make poor spending linked development addictions often produce material garbage cigarettes alcohol also directly lead physical illnesses thus effectively leave disabled certain respects recent top discusses overworked stressed makes one consume relevant point well speaking disability disabled particular often requires material goods order mitigate disabling aspects poor eyesight means buying new glasses every years paraplegic means need wheelchair forth many mental conditions require material aids able function without ipad later parts medication course adds waste top undereducated leave likely live poverty make less aware insidious aspects consumerism lead missing knowledge could potentially reduce consumeristic tendencies working multiple jobs stay afloat hardly time energy read assuming ever pointed direction begin somewhat unfair write sort stuff identity politics issues genuinely bleed every aspect life topic included aside sorts labels used right disarm lot hateful stuff rather openly label autistic give others chance jump label weird loser people fall categories use labels seize power narratives around often filled misinformation prejudice

They are! Planes are the most eco-friendly form of travel humanity has ever invented. There is about zero impact on nature between start and destination.

The only problem that needs to be solved are emissions, and last I've checked, Airbus, Boeing and the engine manufacturers are doing everything they can to solve this. They have economic incentives to do so.

Cars are far more problematic. Even if we switch all cars to electric engines, problems like suburban sprawl, impact on nature due to freeways etc. still persist.

Anticonsumption,"Balenciaga in its current form (the ""social experiment"" people talk about) is actually one man's ideation. Demna Gvasalia is a war refugee from Georgia (the country) and has a very specific viewpoint on fashion and luxury goods. He rose to prominence by subverting fashion's expectations of what defines luxury at his original brand Vetements. For example, Demna noticed DHL employees come to his studio and asked himself why their uniform is considered ""low end"" while a t shirt with the word ""Gucci"" is considered luxurious. He then partnered with DHL to make a Vetements-branded DHL shirt which then went viral by fashion lovers. So while he profited off of his idea, the whole point of it is to subvert the traditional notions of luxury and class.

He then became Balenciaga's creative director and took these themes and merged them with anti-consumerism and apocalyptic portrayals of our future.

The sub-Saharan region is home to some of the largest dumpsites in the world. Out of the total waste generated, almost 13% is plastic and 57% is organic waste. Almost 80% of the waste generated in this region is recyclable and currently only 4% is being recycled.  
The project proposes to start small waste collection centers in backward and rural areas where there is little or no waste collection system.  
Proper waste disposal means no garbage being exposed to the environment. No direct sunlight exposure to the plastic means no harmful gases are being released to the environment. This in turn will bring down the temperature making the earth cooler. Also, the organic waste which is being discarded in the environment can be turned into organic manure creating business opportunities for the locals.

Anticonsumption,"&gt;If we are doing realistic ones, capitalism with UBI and corrections for externalities and market power by the government. Most realistic option imo.

I agree with you, but ours is not a popular opinion. On one hand, you have all the people telling us to stop trying to band-aid &amp; duct tape capitalism when it's a fundamentally-broken system that will never produce ethical outcomes. I hear, respect, and nod to those people. But on the other hand, what they're suggesting boils down to ""we completely overhaul the most complex system in the known universe and replace it with something that is only theoretical"". This is simply not a realistic expectation or plan of action in its current form. We DO need to replace capitalism, but maybe not RIGHT NOW when the literal fate of humanity is teetering on the edge. If your car needs new tires, the middle of a uncontrolled hydroplane spin-out is not the time to try and replace them. Regain control of the vehicle, pull over, and THEN think about replacing them assuming you're still alive.

I feel similarly to these people as I do towards the people that think we're going to fix climate change by inventing some radical new technology that does not exist and has never existed. Maybe it's fusion power, maybe it's carbon sequestration or terraforming, but the common thread is that it's *someone else's responsibility to invent and implement.* I think it's a bad bet to keep hand-waving our problems onto future generations in hopes that they'll have the tools to fix them.

Anticonsumption,"Have you really ? please send me some links! i would love to see other people discuss the topic i like :) 

For the volunteer part : about 80 of jobs are bull shit : ether shell companies for money laundering , scams , selling useless plastic junk, and the main jobs are working for rich parasite scumbags to make them more wealthy. 

The rest will be firefighters, doctors , scientists, inventors , transit , resource gather , farmers, sanitation , electrical , infrastructure, power plants, electrical ,  etc. 

Since the pandemic we saw what was truly needed to prop up society , hospitals , food stores /supply stores. infrastructure, transportation , sanitation , firefighters , i know i'm missing more but its what i can think of on top of my head. 

Things like Chinese factory workers ( random choice there ) miners will be evaluated and deemed necessary / sustainable. miners for what? coal ? we already have better alternatives. miners are an outdated occupation and deadly at that. No need to continue to risk. Factory worker like what type of factory? making junk like more sneakers / clothes / will not be needed. Food factory worker sure ,  water plan factory worker yes , again it will be less factories because most of them are making novelty / access junk.

If you want to say sanitation or sewer worker , people will still volunteer because our basic needs are already met. The volunteers would know they are doing something very important to hold up society , something needed that directly impacts communities / societies world wide. People will feel honored like how a fire fighter does when they volunteer , to help directly in their community. 

It seems your being pessimistic and having faith in people willing to volunteer. you are thinking from your experience instead of a collective one. doing those jobs would be held in high regards like people feeding the homeless at shelters or scientists discovering cures, it would be a honored profession. 

Just how you assume they will be people vying for which professions they want to automate first, there  is the reverse who want to volunteer / stay in the professions still till it automated. like doctors who love helping / saving lives. 

There are still good solid people out there in mass if not there wouldn't be r/HumansBeingBros at all. 

So At the same time we create automated tech to replace those fields for good we will just focus more and more in creating things like cures or better travel , reversing climate change , bringing back extinct animals etc. 

Built on oppression ? those parasites are humans? hmmm don't get it. Those parasites will be ostracized or locked up for the suffering of all people effected by them being greedy wealth / resource hoarders. We would not need them at  all or give them an audience. 

Colonialism will end point blank, all places will be shared by the workers who live there. I think you didn't read A REVOLUTION must happen to obtain RBE , we will not tolerate any oppression what so ever . it will be peoples choice to volunteer or not. Please wrap your head around that notion. 

All you need to know is [HERE the RBE website :](https://moneylesssociety.com/economy/communism-vs-resource-based-economy-a-definitive-guide-how-rbe-will-arise/) They break it down more than i can do.

Anticonsumption,"You have been very vague in listing a random collection of major parts of a countries economy, the residential and commercial, and transport. And then said that most people are unaware that the largest parts of their countries economy also contributes the largest amount of CO2 emissions. This seems kinda obvious to me that it would be the case. And you're also not clear what is NOT part of the residential and commercial sector? Industrial? If so why is it surprising that 2 out of 3 sectors contribute 2/3rds of CO2 emissions? Everyone knows that CO2 emissions are directly linked to the economy and the GDP. That is why its so difficult to deal with climate change. If CO2 emissions made nobody any money then climate change wouldn't be a problem. And even if you're right that everyone is ignorant of this fact, its not exactly hidden and not talked about.

What evidence do you have that the UN is not considering that CO2 emissions will come from urbanization? I feel like that is kindof their job to consider. But also, nobody HAS to listen to the UN. They are just targets and reccomended courses of action. Like the Millennium Development Goals, ""end world poverty"" great concept, didn't happen. Because its just a target, not a law. They could make a goal of 0 CO2 emissions by 2023, great concept. Not gonna happen. So there isn't really a point to them making suggestions that aren't accounting for the fact that developing countries are going to develop.

Developing countries are going to keep on developing and doing whatever the hell they want. Though maybe with a bit less CO2 emissions with the UN helping global cooperation.

""They cannot affordably access many of the new technologies to decarbonise quickly"". So the result is they are not going to use the new technologies, and they are not going to decarbonise quickly.

The rulers of the countries are going to keep doing whatever they want. But now if they chose to participate in fighting climate change know how.

The problem with your comment is that your REAL argument, is hidden in bullshit. Your REAL argument is that; 

""The result [of climate action] is a shrinking of their policy space and human rights, endangering efforts to achieve comparable levels of well-being with those who developed earlier without any constraints"" 

BUT its just a statement of your opinion. The previous paragraphs do not support it. Who cares that what people in developed countries know? Does it matter if the UN is recommending overzelous climate action to countries that will ignore them? 

What human rights will climate action cause to be violated? how?

However, again, after I reloaded the page... the plushie wasn't there but, instead, some text related to the dialogue and stock footage of a crowd of people, someone throwing something away, and then a boardroom.  And that's what I'd seen every time I watched it before and what I've seen every time since I've reloaded the page.  

I don't know why that's happening, or what the deal is, but I don't think it's the fault of the content creator.  And I certainly didn't post a link to a video with that start.

There is a huge reason to worry about food. It's a leading cause of many deleterious environmental factors and is a the forefront of driving the climate crisis.

Anticonsumption,"while not entirelyyyy synonymous, I was saying avoid oxygen lean flame rather than low temp flame.

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/stoichiometric-combustion-d_399.html

As we can see here, a stoichiometric fuel-gas ratio vs a 1:2 fuel-gas ratio halves the CO2 in the flue gas. Releasing carbon dioxide isnt close to biochar (which is literally just charcoal).

Making charcoal is a very different process which is a literal art that colliers (charcoal burners) try to master. You quite simply arent going to be making charcoal. It is wayyyyyyyyyy less air, barely smoldering. Regardless, I fuckin love slash-and-char.

so pretty much with this
""I mean, stuff burning at a low temps can create a great carbon sink &amp; extremely fertile soils""
yes, but these are VERY low temps. The very low temp stuff is good, the very high temp air rich is okay. The middle ground is bad however, and there isnt a way for you to get to the very low charcoal making stuff (not to mention if you did you would be then burning charcoal into co2, which kills the point as its all about keeping charcoal/carbon in the ground instead of in the air). Charcoal soil reduces the CO2 by simply being carbon that isnt oxidized/burnt. 

Simply put, the best thing to do in terms of minimizing gwp (global warming potential) is to have as close to complete combustion as possible. A toasty, air rich fire. Reducing CO2 is good.

Anticonsumption,"I suppose what this take misses out (and more generally, the individual vs. systemic ‘debate’) is that individual behaviour is inseparable from the global consumerist paradigm.

What does the “force of capitalism” refer to? In my mind, it has something to do with the over-production and over-consumption that is leading to environmental breakdown and global warming everywhere. The causes of this include an obsession with economic growth and massive wealth inequalities that drive consumer demand.

Whichever way you look at it, the end of capitalism or consumerism will lead to a massive decline in individual consumption - and if we work for it, a fairer distribution of wealth.

The 1.5C Lifestyles Report published by a coalition of think tanks including the IEEP and the Hot or Cool Institute suggests an 80% reduction in the energy-intensity of lifestyles in the global North is required to meet the 1.5C aspirational target. 

If the end of capitalism is desirable, it must be recognised that a low-energy, low-consumption lifestyle is also desirable.
